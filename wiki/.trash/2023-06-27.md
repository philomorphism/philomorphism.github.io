I am planning to continue the diary. I've been failing doing this diary thing ever since my primary school education. I've lost many archives of my paper-diaries, but i think I still have two of them, which i do not plan to convert into digital form, so let's consider them lost too. there were some electronic offline diaries too which i wrote in word/notepad in my mid teens, but back in 2019 my home PC got hacked and all the data was encrypted by the hacker, so it's lost too. somewhere in the same year i started a new diary on github pages, which didn't work for long i think. and then there was this [failed attempt](https://web.archive.org/https://xinyaanzyoy.github.io/diary/) (alongside [this journal](https://web.archive.org/https://xinyaanzyoy.github.io/journal/) thing) somewhere in 2020. I must note that from the early 2014 to late 2019 I regularly posted on Facebook which i considered to be a part of my diary. though I've deleted my account in early 2020, some of the remains are still visible on my twitter because I x-posted back then. but it didn't really have a "my diary" flavor anyway! so in early 2022 I began writing [this microlog thing](https://web.archive.org/https://xinyaanzyoy.github.io/microlog/microlog.txt) with a flavor of "my diary", but it was more of a "logging my life" thing than a diary really! again, this one didn't last for a long either, it ended in November 2022. it's been 6 months so far, so let's begin something new! I already have the [weblog](https://xinyaanzyoy.github.io/weblog/index.html) set up (though there still are few remaining things) and this [zettelkasten](https://xinyaanzyoy.github.io/zettelkasten/), which this diary is a part of. now the idea is to not have lonely diary notes to be read by future me or someone else, but to make "notes" that interact with the zettelkasten (which i am treating it as a lot of things, including bookmarking, annotations, research paths, and whatnot). I'm putting all the notes in a separate directory, so as to make it portable when needed even though it's interacting with this zettelkasten.

okay, so today I had like 3-4 insights, of general random life stuff. and i can't recall them right now. the whole point of starting this new diary thing in this obsidian markdown format is that i can write down the notes all day with timestamps, instead of jotting down the stream of consciousness in the morning or the stream of thoughts in the evening. idk idk. okay let's GOOOOOOO!
