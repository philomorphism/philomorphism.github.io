## Quotes

> I intend to do everything... to have one way of evaluating experience—does it cause me pleasure or pain and I shall be very cautious about rejecting the painful—I shall anticipate pleasure everything and find it, too, for it is everywhere! I shall involve myself wholly... everything matters! The only thing I resign is the power to resign, to retreat: the acceptance of sameness and the intellect. I am alive... I am beautiful... what else is there? - [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6487015-i-don-t-intend-to-let-my-intellect-dominate-me-and)
