#: [[compositionality]] [[composability]] [[duality]] 

I read [On Compositionality](https://julesh.com/2017/04/22/on-compositionality/) on [[Jules Hedges]]'s blog which motivated me for going deeper into this, also [[Fabrizio Genovese]] has this [response](https://twitter.com/_julesh_/status/1359991402231435268?s=20) kinda post on [medium](https://blog.statebox.org/modularity-vs-compositionality-a-history-of-misunderstandings-be0150033568) (its comments have some interesting stuff).

some interesting stuff in [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=compositionality+vs+composibility&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) google query result:
