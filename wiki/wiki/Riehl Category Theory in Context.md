Riehl's book is considered a good starting point for [[category theory]].

### reviews
[review1](https://tableschairsandbeermugsmathemagician.blogspot.com/2017/05/book-review-category-theory-in-context.html):
> I think the student at absolute minimum would need:  
  1. A decent undergraduate course in abstract algebra, one that contains all the basic definitions and theorems of groups, rings and fields,
  2. A good year-long undergraduate course in linear algebra up to and including diagonalization, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and the Jordan form and  
  3. A good undergraduate course in topology that goes beyond basic point set topology to the fundamental group and basic homotopy in low dimensional spaces.

[review2](I felt much better served by another book on the topic, “Conceptual Mathematics: A First Introduction to Categories):
