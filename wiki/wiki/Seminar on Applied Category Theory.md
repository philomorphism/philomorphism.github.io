### Applied Category Theory: A Philosophical Introduction by David Corfield

- citing [[Rosetta Stone Paper]]:
1. Mathematics (1940s)
2. Logic/Foundation (1960s)
3. Computer Science ([[Computational Trinitarinism]]) (1970s)
4. Physics (1980s)
5. ACT (2010s)
is a great way of looking at how ACT came out. and it totally makes sense!

- read [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]! for:
	Category theory provides both a subjective and an objective logic.

- learn [[String Diagrams]]! and the [[compositionality]] philosophy.
