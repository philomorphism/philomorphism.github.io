### Essay: Prologue to Humankind
we know the history of life on earth because the vertebrates (which actually came way after the genesis) have hard parts that mineralizes. 

a beautiful timeline of life is given. from first life to fishlike invertebrates to bony fish to reptiles to apes to hominids to australopithecines and homos.

### 1 The Path of Evolution
Australopethicus is the firs hominid to wal fully erect, around 3.5M years.

Both human chimpanzee brains are structurally same, human brain has well developed lobes, except the [[occipital lobe]], the one that is responsible for vision, is more well developed in chimpanzees than humans.

I need to learn the [[evolutionary calendar]] properly.

hand use seems to be related to [[intelligence]]. and among the hand users, the language users benefit the most socially. 

Gorilla and humans have a difference of gap between the toe and the fingers of the foot. Perhaps because they way they used them. And same for hands.

[[Evolution]] almost always changes the features of a creature, there are, rather surprisingly, some which haven't changed for millions of years! e.g. [[coelacanth]], [[cycad]], bat, turtle etc.

Here's one beautiful thought I just had given that I have [[Urinary Tract Infection]] right now. I read on reddit that this happens to most women after [[sexual intercourse]]. My [[nephrologist]] told me there are two possibilities in my case, either the ascending infection or just the urinary culture development of [[Escherichia Coli]]. Okay, here's the thought: this book says there was a cost in being erect vertebrate, the size and geometry of female pelvic bone. Brain kept evolving bigger and bigger until it reached a limit of the size of the female [[pelvic bone]]. The solution then was to either keep broadening the pelvic bone, which itself has a limit due to erectness of the overall structure of the body which needs enough vertical support for the weight of the body above, or just make small babies and make them learn to grow bigger outside the [[womb]]. Ofc the latter won the evolutionary battle, and as a result we have dumb or dependent babies than the chimpanzee babies. But this dependence on progenitors gave rise to mutual love or attachment to the level no other animals show, perhaps except few/all other mammals that show some variable of affection. The evolution from [[quadruped]] to [[biped]] also made us being able to have sex face to face! Which too gave rise to marital love (which later turned into romance and stuff and love to marriage i suppose). It seems almost all evolutionary things that made us, us, has given some contribution in our ability to have fith, love, affection, attachment etc... I need to cross check stuff, but if it's true, it's beautiful!!

I need to properly study [[Australopethicus]], [[Homo]], [[Hominid]], [[Neanderthal]] etc...


Hominids were intelligent but not powerful, so they chose to do the hunting in hottest time of the day when larger strong predators were resting. Also they usually took the leftovers of the [[carnivores]]' food, which they are by using their stone tools. But doing this they lost their body hair, because hair in hot temperature doesn't help. In that place they learned to "sweat" as a mechanism to cool the body, which is why they almost always preferred to live by the water source, because that's what they need the most. This "intelligent" way of hunting brought more intelligence than physical assets of a killing machine! Haha 

Big brain, family affection, intelligent food sourcing, selfmade home at the water sources, all that made them incredibly social, and eventually invented languages. Which then affected their existence drastically, eventually making humans beings the things that shaped the surrounding nature rather than the nature shaping them!!

### Essay: Landscapes of the ice age
It's just amazing how global climate and local environments can tweak the evolutionary parameters.

### 2 The People of The Earth
Some humans came to America for the first time, they were from Siberia. I need to read about this more.

It's a worth reading history about how we're both [[herbivore]] and [[carnivores]].

Hominids had an opposable thumb lime ours that worked quite like us, which is what made them different than their primate ancestors.

How hominids discovered fire is unknown. But fire gave rise to many things, perhaps including the idea of "being together as a community", and thus to shelter.

Because homo erectus babies were born comparatively immature than other animals, childcare had to be done, and females did it, while meat hunting went to males. 

[[Neanderthal]]s are called that because their remains were first discovered in Neander Valley in West Germany near DÃ¼sseldorf in 1856. They were perhaps the first to mass produce the tools.

[[Permafrost]] in Europe began somewhere less than a meter away down the ground, which made it a natural [[refrigerator]] to store the surplus meat that Neanderthals had acquired by large-scale hunting using their mass produced tools!

Neanderthals seems to have a religion! Both Animal and man ceremonies/rituals have been excavated. They seem also to have emotions for a stale person who can't work but does consume the share. But they, rather surprisingly to me, don't have any decoration or jwelary and stuff even though they perhaps had flowering thing for the graves of the dead.

By 30-40k BC it's all [[Homo Sapiens Sapiens ]] on the planet, we know it for sure but not how they did it. 

Because homo sapiens sapiens originated in tropical regions, they had dark skin, it is only when they went to western Europe that they developed lighter skin. 

They learned how to build complex shelters, which then led them to have a complex social life. They didn't have leadership concept. They didn't have the concept of private property either! Nor of privacy! They perhapse most likely lived in an [[egalitarian]] society.

[[Homo Sapiens Sapiens]] were the first to have evolved or curved [[palate]] to allow them to vocalize sound in a variety, which then allowed them to construct languages. And linguistic competence did because important when they had established a social life of shelter, food, and dressing, because language allowed them to plan complex tasks that were not self-evident. This linguistic ability made them able to do abstract thinking.

Mass Hunting and scavenging herds of animals by homo sapiens sapiens made extinct most of the species. Which made them husband their resources and change of hunting techniques. Eventually they even learned to do fishing and stuff. But almost around 10K BC they had established agriculture in their repertoire of ideas and practices.

There're several histories of how Americas was colonized, but it seems to be clear that it had been colonized way before few thousand years before Christ.
