I have stopped reading this. doing the nlab and wikipedia reading projects instead.

## Review
This is a wonderful thing I wish I had access to as a child who mostly spent his summer afternoons in lonely projects thinking about aliens and space exploration and the existence of the universe and stuff.  
  
I have access to a gold gilded 1990 version because it's there in my new residential library.  
  
I planned to read the entire encyclopedia cover to cover but I am abandoning it for three reasons:  
1. it takes a LOT of time to go through physical encyclopedias, and I am no longer a free kid  
2. I'm better off reading Wikipedia and nlab articles  
3. I have skimmed through most of the volumes enough to know the depth to which a given entry goes, which is a bit shallow for a graduate subjects student, and to claim that I have "skimmed through" it, lol.  
  
If your kid loves encyclopedias, better make them read Wikipedia and nlab, or perhaps modern physical versions ofÂ [[Childcraft The How And Why Library]].
