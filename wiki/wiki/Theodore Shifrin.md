I was watching [[differential form]] lecture by him [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlo2V8H5khM&list=PL5I-Eyk8l9FHdJUd9UujGcvumjCFPHbrd&index=113), and I'm loving it, especially his ability to let students engage, just wonderful! I've never ever seen a lecturer like this before, his engagement is unearthed to be really honest. I'd say further that his students are wonderful too! (or perhaps I've never seen a real school! idk! but I've watched hundreds of lectures from yale, stanford, mit, oxford, iit and whatnot! but this guy rocks!)
