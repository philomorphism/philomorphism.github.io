the paper seems to answer where to how to look. the [[water hole]] is mentioned indirectly.

I need to reread this after I learn some notions mentioned in the paper like power, galactic 
background, etc.

what are these units? Mc./s. and c./s.

the [[Alpha Centauri]] is mentioned too as one of the candidates that satisfies following conditions:
1. within 15ly 
2. sun-like luminosity and lifetime 
3. high background. it's near the galactic plane standing against the high back.
(7 of them, 3 ([[Alpha Centauri]], [[70 Ophiuchi]], [[61 Cygni]]) in this way in the hich back, and 4 others ([[Tau Ceti]], [[Epsilon Eridani]], [[Epsilon Indi]], [[40 Eridani]]) are in the low background direction)

Mc./s. is I think Megacycles per second, same for c./s. where a cycles/second is now known as a Hertz.

the [[water hole]] is related to [[Hydrogen Line]], I should be able to derive the line from [[quantum mechanics]], but later.
