I should read the birth of tragedy:
- the birth of tragedy is about why experience is very important form a person says Anna Gat concluding how fiction and media based on fiction are very important. she says fiction turns one into a whole person with range that one can trust. she has a cool line:
> I like to say the content of a nonfiction book is its content. The content of fiction is you.

- Ruxandra Teslo also argues all the utilitarian people should read more fiction, especially techbros and economists.
