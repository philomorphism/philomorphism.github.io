## Review
**A Beautiful Portrait of five pictures of life and an interpretations thereof to define What Life Is**

As the title of the review suggests, the book contains five pivotal ideas of life sciences: that of A Cell, A Gene, Evolution, Chemistry, and Information. Paul takes them as a reductionist ladder rugs to understand what life is, and therefore ultimately defining it, by first understanding what life does. 

He concludes the book with a chapter on how, as the humanity whole, to change/help the world having the knowledge of what life is, and another chapter on his definition and future speculations on the frontiers of both the life science and applications thereof including biological technologies and ethical human values.

His (paraphrased) definition of life is as follows: "Any entity that can evolve through evolution, is physically-bounded, and is physical-chemical-information machine is alive." He models this definition based on the five pivotal pictures of life explained in the preceding chapters. Physically boundedness is modeling the existence of cell and aggregate thereof, for which the first chapter is devoted to. Evolution is taken to be the first principle, for which the third chapter is devoted to. physical machine is modeled on the existence of the beautiful "DNA->RNA->Proteins" information flow, the central dogma of molecular biology, as quoted by one of the discoverer of the DNA structure, Francis Crick, for which the second chapter is devoted to. chemical machine is modeled on the existence of chemistry of enzyme proteins and like organic molecules and chemical reactions thereof, for which the fourth chapter is devoted to. in the last, and fifth, 'idea' chapter, chemical gradients, based on which information in DNA gives rise to complex spatial structures of an organism, are talked about and various other information processing tasks an aggregate of cells do to evolve in a particular fashion, this then is taken as a model of information machine.

Few chunks of history and Paul's own work, which won him a 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, on the control mechanism of cell division cycle are also seen beautifully interspersed with the story of five great ideas.

The only irritating thing is sometimes he doesn't go deeper into the stuff I expected him to, but given that it's a 98 pages book, and that his choice of words, analogies, and examples are perfect, making the reader "get the idea", this is a wonderful book to read for those who haven't had an exposure to either of the aforementioned five great ideas of life science. 

I love that he has a hope of an arc in the sphere of scientific frontiers leading to understand what life is through comprehension of the coherent consistent ideas coming from all sorts of human thought, from physics and chemistry to mathematics, computer science and philosophy! for that's how my curious brain actually work and wishes to, at least until I become just a subset of genomes of my, um, ..., whatever! go bliss the book, now!

## Notes
### 1. The Cell: Biology's Atom
wonderfully, it's [[Robert Hooke]] who named cells, cell. which he observed, in 1665, on the cork by the help of a microscope he built for himself!

then [[Anton Van Leeuwenhoek]] observed a single-celled life, in a pond water sample and plaque of his "hygienic" teeth, which is the first recorded account of observed bacteria. it's frightening to know that none prior to 17th century knew about the microcosmos. this makes me feel like we might not know about the quantum-living-world either, though it pretty much sounds like the world of antman scifi.

all human body has the ratio around 1 of the human cells to non-human ones.

it seems like system thinking came into existence in around 1858, as Rudolf Virchow is quoted here:
> that every animal appears as a sum of vital units, each of which bears in itself the complete characteristics of life.

[[Cell Theory]] originates when [[Theodore Schwann]] concludes this [[compositionality]] of living units for all the organisms.

then biologists concluded that all the cells come from other cells by the process of [[cell division]], which is the first step in the hierarchical(?) process of going from a single fertilized egg to organic mass, and eventually to an [[embryo]]. the point here is that life doesn't come from innate stuff, not at least all the time, that is perhaps at the genesis(?). it is also frightening that [[selfishness]] emerges from an agent which is embodied in a full-fledged evolved embryo, which once was nothing but a single fucking cell! [[I am That]].

In 70s Paul started studying Yeast cells to understand how cells reproduce and their control mechanism for the division. [[Yeast]] is a [[fungus]] but are similar to plant and animal cells, why?

A [[Cell]], has a boundary made up of [[lipid]] and [[organelles]] of which the [[nucleus]] contains the [[genetic information]] that's written into the [[chromosome]], and bunch of [[mitochondria]] which are energy sources are preset too. this description feels more like a machine than a life, to me. but the existence of nucleus-less [[prokaryotes]], as opposed to the [[eukaryotes]], makes it understandable because it means that not everything is machine/living life, there are some living programs/viruses(?). so clearly living cells are clearly different from [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]]. they're not living, right?

every cells have the boundary. so is life related to the concept of inside and outside. (checkout a lecture on [[Laws of form]]). paul connect the existence of boundaries with [[Entropy]], that boundary is important requirement to reduce the entropy locally.

### 2. The Gene: The Test of Time
[[Gregor Mendel]] discovered the existence of genes by experimenting with the pea plants (which he did in around 1860 according to wikipedia). and [[Charles Darwin]] at the same time was doing a similar experiment with the flowers of snapdragons. both of them came up with the similar ratios of various characteristics. so [[Gregor Mendel]] is a pioneer of [[genetics]], the particular model goes by [[Mendelism]], which proposed that inherited characteristics are due to the presence of "physical particles", aka [[gene]]. every one of my cell have genes, which are in pair of which the elements come from an [[egg]] and a [[sperm]].

[[Walther Flemming]] observed some threads (aka [[chromosome]]) in the cells that divided when the cell did. [[Edouard van Beneden]] then established [[Mendelism]] to be true for all [[eukaryotes]] by observing the fertilized eggs of parasitic roundworms.

every of my [[Cell]]s have [[chromosome]] except the [[red blood cell]]s, why!?

in 1944 [[Oswald Avery]] and his team discovered gene-carrying chromosomes to be [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] aka deoxyribonucleic acid, which began a new age of [[genetics]]. 

just so this doesn't get more confusing as i go on: cell <- nucleus <- chromosomes <- genes =? DNA. 

the 2nd human chromosome is made up of about 1300 different genes (8 cm). so 2m (>46x8) long DNA (why only 22k genes?) in a cell, and about 20 billion km long for about trillion cells of a human body. which is about 3 times far away from the position where voyager 1 captured the [[Pale Blue Dot]] on 14th of feb, 1990. just wonderful! 

so, the conclusion is that genes are chemical elements! the stuff we can understand through physics.

in 1953 [[The Secret of Life; Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, and the Discovery of DNA's Double Helix]] happened.

because proteins do all the work in a cell, it needs to convert DNA language into protein language. by the 1960s it was known what the translation is. it's this relationship that's known as [[genetic code]]. before the early 70s it became clear "how" the cell did this translation. 

just so that I don't forget: [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] is arranged in groups of 3 nucleic acids, most of which correspond to one specific amino acid building block of a protein. a [[gene]] then is a sequence of DNA words (word=a group of 3 [[nucleic acid]]s of DNA) which is exactly what's needed to create a protein. 

e.g. a human gene beta-globin is 441 DNA letters long, and therefore the translated [[protein]] with 147 [[amino acid]]s long. this beta-globin protein then helps haemoglobin for something paul doesn't go into.

in the late 1970s the chromosomes of [[Escherichia Coli]] were modified to contain a human gene that contains the [[insulin]] protein. it's wonderful to know that this is how diabetes has been managed so far! (perhaps some new stuff is being used these days?)

in the same 70s [[Fred Sanger]] sequenced some DNA and won 2 [[Nobel Prize]]s. 

by the end of 20th century complete DNA sequencing of organisms was possible! and by 2003 that was done for human, containing about 3 billion (calculate!) DNA [[nucleic acid]]s!! wow! checkout [[Human Genome Project]] which gave us a list of about 22k protein-encoding genes that are common to all humans.

[[cell cycle]] is a mechanism by which a cell coordinates the copying of the genes and the division of the cell. it brings together all the non-living processes or chemical reactions into one system that has a specific purpose. perhaps this is where chemistry becomes biology?

here's the thing: all(?) the cell processes are run by genes and proteins they produce. so is the cell cycle! "which genes are responsible for the cell cycle?" is the question paul was set out to do at his lab.

mutations can occur through 
1. [[UV radiation]], 
2. chemical damage, or 
3. the internal [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] replication error. (about 3 mutations happen at each cell division, which is an error of 1 in billion DNA letters)

to find the [[fission yeast]] cell division control genes, paul looked for the mutants that were able to grow but not divide, which actually made him know the genes that were required in the cycle. but to really find the controller gene, he looked for the small mutated cells (which he called wee mutants) because the hypothesis was that their clock ran too fast that they didn't have time to grow and so they divided as small. he then also found another control gene too, which he called wee1. and then he found another one which he called [[cdc2]] (cell division cycle 2) by the experiment which he first threw in the trashbin!

how does a life form kinda stays constant while also have ability to change? that's Evolution by natural selection.

### 3. Evolution by Natural Selection: Chance and Necessity
religions and creation myths commonly say things like:
- life was created in a few days
- diversity and intricacy implies intelligent design by the god
for diversity:
> whoever God is, He has an inordinate fondness for
beetles - [[J. B. S. Haldane]]

for intricacy:
[[William Paley]] in 1802 had a thought experiment in which we found a clock on the road while just walking, and concluded that its intricacy implies an intelligent designer, and that same logic applies to life.

complex life forms with a purpose can be understood through [[natural selection]].

in [[On the Origin of Species]], in 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] proposed the theory of [[natural selection]] as a conclusion of the observations after having traveled the world and collected various specimens of various kingdoms. earlier in the 18th century [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] furthered the earliest observations on evolution by [[Aristotle]]. even darwin's grandfather [[Erasmus Darwin]] believed in evolution which is visible in his motto "everything from shells". [[Alfred Wallace]] too independently put forth the same theory/mechanism. paul says both of them actually followed the speculation on natural selection by [[Patrick Matthew]] in his book on "naval timber" (learn about this!)

observation on artificial selection helped darwin in developing the natural selection theory.

"survival of the fittest" is not darwin's phrase.

paul says today some of the engineering stuff like aircrafts' designs are optimized by algorithms that mimic natural selection, so it's more like an evolved products and not new designs! (MUST READ MORE ABOUT THIS)

three necessary characteristics for a living organism to undergo natural selection:
1. reproducibility
2. hereditary system
3. variability in the hereditary system, and variability must be during the reproductive process.
natural selection operates on this variability.

also, for this to work "efficiently", organisms must die! for the reasons of replacement.

this is more like a model built on the ideas of how a cell works. error rate for DNA replication is the key to natural selection, a right balance between constancy and change.

checkout [[2023-07-21#19 31]].

paul, in 1980s at a cancer research lab in london, wanted to know if the cell cycle genes are same for both humans and fission yeast. he already knew that cdc2 is a gene for cell division in fission yeast, so he, for the reasons of evolutionary time, which is more than a billion years, thought the same is unlikely to be true in humans. but it turned out to be TRUE!! [[Melanie Lee]] in paul's lab sprinkled (whatever that means) a library of human genes on cdc2 defective fission yeast cells and observed the growth! indicating the human equivalent of cdc2 controlled the division of fission yeast and formed a colony. this shows that cdc2 is an invention that endured for more than a billion years, and that we can understand ourselves by understanding basic life forms!

evolutionary system is both responsible for our existence and existence of diseases! which means [[population biology]]=[[evolutionary biology]] for certain things, e.g understanding [[cancer]].

[[Evolution]] by [[natural selection]] describes how life forms, not how they work. [[Life]] as [[Chemistry]] and [[Information]] are two answers.

### 4. Life as Chemistry: Order from Chaos
"Life IS chemistry" has its origin in the studies of fermentation, which began in 18th century by [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who is one of the founders of [[chemistry]]. He proposed something called "ferment" to be present in grapes that helped the "chemical reaction" in which [[sugar]]s of grape juice was converted into the ethanol of the finished wine. then later [[Louis Pasteur]] proposed microbial life form yeast to be the "ferment". this [[glucose]] to [[ethanol]] reaction of [[yeast]] cells made him summarize his theory by "[[chemical reaction]]s are an expression of the [[life]] of the [[cell]]", that is [[life]]=[[chemistry]].

chemistry happens inside the [[Cell]] too. in fact that's how cells actually form, maintain, grow, organize, and reproduce. this [[chemistry]] of [[life]] is [[metabolism]].

later, [[Marcelin Berthelot]] extracted a substance, which he called [[invertase]] (because it's an [[enzyme]]), from the pulverized yeast cells that broke [[sucrose]] into [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. 

most phenomena of life can be best understood in terms of [[chemical reaction]]s that are catalyzed by enzymes. 

most enzymes are made from [[protein]]s which are built by [[polymer]]s. most [[enzyme]]s, [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[fat]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, [[deoxyribonucleic acid]], [[ribonucleic acid]] etc are all [[polymer]]s.

[[polymer]]s inside the [[cell]]s are long chains, very long! like in the order of millions sometimes, e.g. DNA. they're called [[macromolecules]], they're molecular, though slender, threads!

each [[protein]] is a [[polymer]] built by joining smaller [[amino acid]]s. e.g. [[invertase]] is a protein [[molecule]] made by linking together 512 amino acids in a specific, ordered sequence. protein polymers are in the order of hundred to thousands in numbers in a single thread.

life uses only(?) 20 amino acids. I need to learn about [[Protein Folding Problem]]. 1d to 3d transformation of the chain of a protein molecule gives a unique shape, why? invertase binds to sucrose but this binding requires a specific property which is here a perfect fitting of the parts of sucrose and invertase, so a cell can build this required anzyme by knowing which shape is required and how to translate that into a linear chain that can then fold into 3d structure of the required shape.

"Enzymes execute almost all the chemical reactions that form the basis of cellular metabolism".

A cell, for example yeast cell, contains proteins in the order of 40 millions in number! the number of chemical reactions in a cell is in the order of thousands while that in even the largest industrial plastic factory is of tens.

there's this [[spectrum]] of time, from infinitely slow to immensely fast. evolution and mechanics of a cell are two extremes. some of the enzymes work at the order between thousands and millions of reactions per second that too with a good precision, accuracy, and reliability! almost like a computer. given the order of magnitude of time it took to form them, this is more like a learning algorithm.

anzymes is the reason why various kinds of reactions can coexist within a compact space of cell. but [[compartmentation]] plays a role too, as it does in all the [[complex system]]s.

the chemicals on which enzymes act on are called [[substrate]]s. enzymes bind on to a substrate to manipulate, extraordinarily precisely, a particular atom or a bond between the two. invertase breakes, for example, a particular bond between [[oxygenn]] and [[carbon]] in a sucrose molecule. many enzymes can act on one substrate serially but binding compositionally, and this things is called [[metabolic pathways]]. 

paul doesn't mention [[flagellum]] or names of similar stuff or the structure thereof, but he talks about how enzymes copy DNA with an incredible precision. he asks to imagine them as machines, and then mentions "molecular motors", which i hope is flagellum or something like that, and how they power most of the motions within the cell, e.g as carriers, and how the "ratchet like mechanisms" are used to not get unwanted collisions. and that, versions of these motors also help create the force needed to separate chromosomes and cleave dividing cells into half. they work in masses, given that their size is incredibly small, in the order of billions. and mentions these individual proteins can show macroscopic effects like wings of a butterfly, movements of an eye, and speeds of cheetahs.

at a larger scale than enzymes and molecular machines are structures of cellular devices built out of groups of proteins, e.g. [[ribosome]]s which are where the proteins are made! a little circular but this is biology, and it's beautiful! enzymes are at the scale such their string of thousands is about the diameter of a typical human hair. ribosomes can do that with a string of hundreds. a ribosome contains tens of proteins and some large [[ribonucleic acid]]s. a cell has ribosomes in the order of millions!

a temporary copy of a specific gene is made, which is called a messenger RNA, and is transported to a ribosome, which then uses it to build a protein.

the smallest structures in a cell are enzyme's surfaces. and the biggest ones are the organelles, which are bigger than ribosomes. each organelles have their own lipid membrane wrapper. e.g [[nucleus]].

a string of 2-3 white blood cells can match the diameter of a human's hand hair. about 10% of those cells' size is their nucleus, which is a big percentage than that of the same in an atom, which is like 1/10^5%, after all it has to contain that big string of DNA!

because [[chloroplast]]s are not present in animals, unlike plants and [[algae]], [[photosynthesis]], which is a set of chemical reactions that uses [[energy]] from the sunlight to drive transformation of water and carbon dioxide into sugar and oxygen,is not present in them. enzymes for photosynthesis are located within the two layers of membrane surrounding the chloroplast. 

all the cells of a grass blade contain chloroplast in the order of hundred, each of which contain several of proteins, one of which is called [[chlorophyll]]s, which is present in high density, and because of which the sunlight's red and blue is absorbed, for the energy required for photosynthesis, resulting the green appearance of the grass blade!

the [[atmosphere]] contains [[carbon dioxide]], photosynthesis converts it into sugars, which then is eaten by fungi from the woods, sheeps from grass, whales from plankton in seas, and humans from crops. polymers that build an animal body is built out of carbon, and it comes from sugars, and ultimately from photosynthesis, and therefore the [[Sun]]! A star and a cloud of gas is, therefore, nothing but a life, it's just a matter of time, or is it? where did the [[Consciousness]] come from in this system?

ha! I just wrote this [[2023-07-24#00 27]] and paul now mentions [[geothermal energy]]! because when the life appeared, about 3.5 billion years ago, photosynthesis was not yet in the repository! and as a result there was no oxygen! ^930b4e

between 2.4-2 billion years ago the earth went through The Great Oxygen Catastrophe. every life on earth was a [[microbe]], and they were in high population that most of them died because of oxygen! they produced the oxygen just to kill themselves, haha! minority survived either by living at the bottom of seas or evolved to live in oxygenated environment. and today we live on oxygen! 

cellular respiration is opposite of photosynthesis. photosynthesis builds sugars from carbon dioxide and sunlight, while the respiration break the sugar by reacting with oxygen to release energy, water, and carbon dioxide. we use/inhale oxygen to break sugars, and other stuff, down to get energy. the final stages of sugar breaking happens in [[mitochondria]], so that's how mitochondria supplies energy to the cell.

mitochondria occupies about 40% of the volume of heart cells!

energy released in the [[cellular respiration]] is stored as follows: the reaction in mitochondria releases [[proton]]s, which are push up into the two lipid layers of the [[membrane]] of mitochondria. now around the inner layer, on one side there is a built up positive charge while on the other side is either neutral(?) or less positive(?), and we can now do [[physics]] from here, but i don't quite understand it yet. through specific protein channels the current runs back into the mitochondria, ??? and energy gets stored in the form of high-energy bonds. ??? paul mentions "molecular turbines" as certain protein structures, the current through the protein channel goes through this turbine and turns the rotor which then helps driving the generation of chemical bonds ??, and as a result a molecule is created called [[adenosine triphosphate]]. this reaction is happens at about 150 reactions per second.

it was [[Peter Mitchell]] who proposed this model of energy storage in a cell.

ATP/[[adenosine triphosphate]] is like a battery, when a reaction in a cell needs energy, the cell breaks ATP's high-energy bond, turning it into [[adenosine diphosphate]]/ADP. (I have a question that this energy is discrete, and perhaps not all of the released energy gets used, so perhaps the cell heats up, all the time? which then requires some sore of thermal equilibrium process, right? paul is becoming more and more vague as we move to the end of the book)

all the living things get their constant energy from this process of proton flow towards the layer and then ATP to ADP! this is the spark of life, but merely a physical process. where then the [[automation]] and [[Consciousness]] come from?

paul sought an answer to "what exactly does a cdc2 protein do, chemi-physically?" this low level question requires [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]] can only offer an overview which we already know for our problem in hand.

there are these things called [[kinase]], a kind of [[enzyme]] that catalyze reactions in which a phosphate group is transferred from high-energy phosphate-donating molecule to some specific substrates, there are several kinds, one of which is [[protein kinase]], which acts on substrates that are proteins. this acting is called [[phosphorylation]]. 

it turns out [[cdc2]] protein is a [[protein kinase]]! cdc2 binds to [[cyclin]], which activates it as a kinase, which is called [[Cyclin Dependent Kinase]]/CDK. 

[[cyclin]] was discovered by [[Tim Hunt]] because it is a protein that 'cycled' up and down in level through the cell cycle, which made the CDK complex turn on and off at the right time. CDK exterts it controlling force on the cellular process of the cell cycle by phophorylation of large number of different proteins all at once.

### 5. Life as Information: Working as a Whole
an organism takes in a lot of information from the surrounding, processes it, and then takes an action by the virtue of its local purpose.

I am loving this quote:
> "the parts of a living body exist for the sake of the whole being, and
that the whole being exists for the sake of its parts" - [[Emmanuel Kant]] 

paul claims biology is a science where it makes sense to talk about [[purpose]], as opposed to [[physics]], why?

organization is an important property of a living system, so is cohesiveness, and communication.

[[Christiaan Huygens]] invented [[Centrifugal Governor]] which [[James Watt]] adapted successfully to control the constancy of [[steam engine]].

[[homeostasis]], which is a mechanism by which a cell stays in equilibrium w.r.t certain variable, is done essentially through similar mechanisms. 

the [[genetic code]] needed to build ribosomes of various organisms are same, which means it has been preserved for over 3 billion years!

the [[double helix structure]] ([[The Secret of Life; Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, and the Discovery of DNA's Double Helix]]) emphasizes why chemistry of life only makes sense when it is considered in terms of [[Information]].

[[gene regulation]], a set of chemical reactions cell uses to turn on and off a specific gene to be used, is constantly being used in forming a full human body from a formless [[embryo]].

only about 5th of the 22k human genes are actually used to carry out the important regular operations in all the cells of the body! the remaining are used only occasionally!!

gene regulation is done through proteins called "activators" and "repressors". this is done by binding to a specific DNA sequence in the vicinity of the gene to be regulated, which then makes it more or less likely that a messenger RNA is produced and sent to [[ribosome]] to make a protein.

[[drug]]s and [[antibiotic]]s are based on gene regulation.

[[Jacques Monod]] and [[François Jacob]] won nobel prize for this information-theoretic perspective on gene regulation. [[Escherichia Coli]] could live on one or the other of two sugars. each sugar needed enzymes made by different genes to break it down. how did the bacteria decide how to switch between the two sugars, that is how did it know to build new enzymes when a new sugar was given. it turns out it has a repository of only two(?) feeding sugars, one is primary and the other is secondary. it always eats up the first one, but keeps looking for the alternative secondary one. by default a repressor protein is deactivating the gene required for the alternative sugar's enzyme production, but when the sugar is available it binds to the repressor making it inactive and therefore the gene active, so the required enzymes are produced. essentially to control a two state system, one switch is there, but requiring one state to be default. the important thing here is that they found this information flow from gene sequence to protein to cellular function by purely informational approach and not bio-chemical one. 

this shows a cell is a process in the space of states. at a particular spacetime the cell has a state which then it interprets and from then on physics-chemistry-biology happens. paul wanted to know what's the picture of this kind for the [[cell cycle]].

paul mentions [[negative feedback loop]] as a particular kind of information-processing module.

here's how the body stores extra sugars: when the excess is detected in blood, the cells in pancreas release [[hormone]] [[insulin]] into the bloodstream which triggers the cells in liver, muscles, and fatty tissues to absorb sugar from the blood and store as either insoluble glycogen or fat for later use. 

in contract [[positive feedback loop]] is a two state machine with one of them being the sink.

such on-off-switches have gene-protein level things, they build the oscillating or recurring movements like that of beating heart, waling legs etc...

paul is now trying to come up with an argument that feels more like [[compositionality]], and it makes sense because [[category theory]] is after all a way to talk about processes/[[process philosophy]].

computer [[hardware]] and [[software]] are quite different from [[wetware]], the term coined by [[Dennis Bray]], a [[systems biology]]-ist.

[[signalling pathways]] is the way a cell communicates within itself ans outside of it. they work by transmitting information within cells, between [[organ]]s, between whole [[organism]]s, and even between different [[specie]]s across whole [[ecosystem]].

cells signal through space by having duration of two state alphabet, and through time by storing the information. ^025f47

long-term memory is stored in DNA, but where is the short-term one stored? 

short-term memory is used in cell cycle.

[[Conrad Waddington]] coined the term [[epigenetics]], describing how a cell remembers what a growing embryo told it, that the cells become specialized and remains so even after the growth, a long time. this is an enduring [[gene regulation]].

it's three kinds of memories here at play: stable ([[deoxyribonucleic acid]], [[Read Only Memory]]), long-term (enduring [[gene regulation]], [[Hard Disk]]), and short-term (??, [[Random Access Memory]]). 

How does spatial structure emerge from a single uniform egg cell [[chemical gradient]]s is the key. [[Alan Turing]] worked on this! [[reaction-diffusion model]] gives rise to [[self-organization]] property of a cell/organism. [[developmental biology]] seems to be using/proving this.

[[Sydney Brenner]] observed: 
> Mathematics is the art of the perfect. Physics is the art of the optimal. Biology, because of evolution, is the art of the satisfactory.

[[Occam's Razor]] sometimes doesn't work, especially in [[biology]], for example due to redundancy and less efficiency. (and less rationality too?)

paul's lab genetically engineered the yeast cells to generate a simplified cell cycle control circuit. [[cdc2]] turned out to be one of the important cell cycle regulators. the proteins that are required early in the cycles are phosphorylated earlier by the concentration of cdc2 and cyclin containing cdk protein complexes, which grow with time, and since the early proteins are more sensitive to cdk enzyme activity than late ones, low concentration can put the cell in next phase. and that's how the cell is controlled! by the concentration of cdc2, cyclic containing cdk, and other proteins.

learn how [[Information]] is processed at each level of the biological organization. the way from describing complexity to understanding complexity is in comprehension of the information flows of a particular biological organization.

we still do not know why the population of insects is falling.

### Changing the World
How does [[Anaesthesia]] work? is it really related to [[Consciousness]]? why is there [[Potassium]] in it? why was it infused into [[heart]]? How do the machines that take the role of a lung and a heart work? do [[antibiotic]]s always work? are they only used for [[bacteria]]l infection? is there any other way to deal with bacterial infection? what's used for the viral infection? fungal infection? worms? [[parasite]]s? [[pestilence]]s?

what is a [[vaccine]]?

what is a [[virus]]? [[coronavirus]]? [[ebola]]? 

[[CRISPR-Cas9]] is gene-editing thing.

### What is Life?
