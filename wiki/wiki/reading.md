### A dirty computation
Imagine a regularly reading healthy human body, it makes sense to assume they read a book a week or about ~5x10^1 books/year, that is ~5x10^2 books/decade, further assuming the actual book count begin somewhere in late teens or early 20s, say at 21st year (in my case it's 14-15th year), and the body lives ~7x10^1 years, and that the linear model works, the total book count of the body's entire life then is ~25x10^2=BC_0. 
I desire to be at least 4 BC_0. as far as i can tell without looking it up, [[Bill Gates]] seems to be between 1 and 1.5 BC_0. given that he wasn't born in the world of tech I must be >1.5 BC_0. Jen (~30?) seems to be "trying" (her most stuff seems to be private) to reach 6 BC_0!! Manny (65) "is" at around 1.2 BC_0, William (37) "is" at 0.93 BC_0, and i am not sure how to interpret Nitin's ~6.7 BC_0.
I do not think BC_0 is big enough volume to be called an explorer, and I do not wish to live my entire life in the books, that is >~5 BC_0. so 2-4 BC_0 is something that makes sense for me. If I assume the max upper bound then I will have to read ~10k books before i turn 70. which roughly translates to 200 books/year, which is insane! If I assume the min upper bound then ~5k books translates to 100 books/year. which too seems insane! though I've seen people crossing 100 on goodreads I do not think most of those are deep enough books, so 100 is indeed a hard thing itself If I am trying to read only technically deep, non-fiction, history, and only occasionally classic, sci-fi, romance, and all. but I'll try! I will try my best to cross 100, but that's just a goal not my purpose.
I have yet to enter into goodreads database the books i read as a teenager, which are hard to just search because most of them were non-english. but once I do that I'll know what the error terms should be since this "goal" thing is actually starting from 24th year.
