his works on relativity is beautiful.
also, he has a [[quantum theory of consciousness]] with [[stuart hameroff]].

[this](https://youtu.be/sGm505TFMbU?si=E73dqvTmmI5MJ4nn) interview by curt is amazing! i think if i ever want to summarise pentose's works, as there doesn't seem to be any biography yet (but he did mention some book coming out?), I should refer to this interview and expand from there.

I would like to read all of his works. I say that for many people on this wiki, but I'd like this man to be the first priority.

I should build a playlist of all the videos concerning him like this https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXjpiiAr8QGIA9X4NYVSS_xlGVGSmmj6O
