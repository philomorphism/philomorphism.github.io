I have always wanted to build a little computer of my own. I remember the days as a 11-12yo I dissembled a handheld console to make it look like an AV/TV gaming console. It worked for few hours, and then it stopped working because I had no soldering skills and stuff.

back in the uni I wanted to build an 8bit computer, but got lost in so many other projects! but i did satisfy myself by theory and some simulations and stuff.

when i came back home because of covid I told my sister we'll build a small calculator, but that never happened for some reasons!

I'd like to do this:

and perhaps first the LFS thing, and things [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/jugfsf/from_the_transistor_to_the_web_browser_george/) post advises, I have already went down the https://www.nand2tetris.org path, would love to do it again with my sister.
