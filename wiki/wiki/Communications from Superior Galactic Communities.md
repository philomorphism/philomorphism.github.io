the argument, I believe, is that a superior community won't be able to build 50 over-a-megawatt-cosuming transmitters, so it'd try to build a relay of probes housing radio transmitters with an intelligent machine capable of communicating back if an external radio signal responded. the [[Bracewell Probe]]s. this is ofc a scifi lol.

there's this graph in it, which is claimed to be derived from galactic mass distribution model, which i need to look into. 

based on the graph there are some calculations about possibility to build an interstellar radio traffic given the constraints, I need to reread this later.
