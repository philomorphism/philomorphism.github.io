#book 
@: [[Henri Poincar√©]]

I read the first chapter of this book in 2019-2020 and i loved it, it shaped me. i didn't know back then that it was a part of this book though. i am not sure where i read it (i think as a pdf in the reference/external links section of a wiki page which i can't find now) but [this](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Poincare_Intuition/) page seems to be it. I'll soon begin read this, and all of his books.
