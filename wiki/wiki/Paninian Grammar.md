I've been meaning to learn this since like i was 15/16. but I have never been able to go further than first few sutras. also there is this [pdf](https://archive.org/details/panini-article-for-pub/) where the author talks about mathematical structure of the shiva sutras. if i recall it right, it is based on setoid or something and proving that sutras are unique in some sense(?) and therefore to conclude the intelligence of panini.
