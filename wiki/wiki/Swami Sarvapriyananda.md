i just found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUQNwwEzzuU) video while searching some sites for his works/lectures, and he gives a bold claim, which i have known for quite a long time now that he holds it, namely that of not being able to reduce consciousness to matter, especially in the sense of building artificial networks imitating human behavior but not the human itself. (feels truly [[anthropomorphism]]-ic or whatever but yeah i was born with this belief if my memory works fine)

i must watch this [dialogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yISwMDIpCLI) again later, and built bullet-point list of ideas from it.
