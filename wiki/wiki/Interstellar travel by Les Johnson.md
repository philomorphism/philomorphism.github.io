obv it's the [[Aerospace Engineering]] thing!

red dwarfs can't be seen with naked eye, so no proxima centauri. but, from the southern hemisphere (where India is not) the the crux constellation can be seen, and [therefore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux#Use_in_navigation) alpha centauri. 

proxima centauri: 4.2 ly (physics is easy, but engineering is hard.)
andromeda galaxy: 2.5 mly (~liftime, physics impossible)

exoplanets were not known before 1990. now it's more than 5k, lying under the radius of 300 ly from the sun.

~100-400B exoplanets in our galaxy.

**question: how to get to the exoplanets?**
