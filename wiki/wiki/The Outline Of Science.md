### Introduction
> It goes without saying that no one can call himself educated who does not understand the central and simple ideas of Mendelism and other new departures in biology.

### 1 The Romance Of The Heavens
#### The Scale of The Universe
- two classes of heavenly bodies: the planets and the stars.
###### The Heavenly Bodies
- here's how i would like to remember the [[solar planets]]: Mercury-Venus, Earth-Mars, and JSUN; Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. sorry Pluto. 
- [[Alpha Centauri]] is 4.24 lys away.
- [[sirius]] the brightest star in the sky is double that distance.
- from the [[polaris]] the earth rotates counterclockwise once a [[sidereal day]].
- earth's orbital speed is once a [[sidereal year]].
- the sun is about 333k heavier than the earth.
- [[Solar Eclipse]] and [[Lunar eclipse]] is when the sun or moon gets shadowed. i still have some inconsistencies in my imagination need to clear it out soon.
###### The Scale of the Universe
- I never witnessed the [[milky way galaxy]] belt at night, so it was amazing to see it when i was at the [[The 2024 Assembly of The Order of the Octopus]] conference. I think it is very important to have seen it through bare eyes to really appreciate the stuff I read/learn.
- the estimation of the number of stars here is like 2 orders of magnitude off from the estimate we have now, which is 100-400 billion stars.
- he says that for centuries we knew all the solar relative distances, so just discovering one in actuality would result in us knowing all of them in actuality. the trigonometry and geometry world! [[parallax]].
- the sun is at about 150 million kms. the [[Astronomical Unit]]. the radius of the earth's orbit around the sun.
- the parallax effect must get minute for the more distant objects, making measuring their distances harder and harder. so the new method is to measure the distances based on the faintness of the stars. [[luminosity]], [[Cosmic distance ladder]]. 
###### Are there other Universes?
- perhaps by [[universe]] the author means a [[galaxy]], it's an early 20th century book after all. author also seems to call it stellar system.
#### The Solar System
##### The Sun
> [[Spectroscope]] is the greatest instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of man.
###### The Solar System
###### The Sun
- [[stellar corona]] is the outermost layer of the [[stellar atmosphere]].
- the spectrum of the [[solar corona]] showed a line that was not at the time producible in the lab so the name to a new hypothesised element was given, [[Coronium]], but we now know that it was caused by extremely ionised iron (+13).
###### Regions of the Sun
- the [[photosphere]] is the enveloping layer of the [[solar core]]. (actually it's the 3rd layer as per wiki)
- the next later is [[chromosphere]]. he mentions a reversing layer in-between but i don't see any such in-between layer on the wiki page, i must read about this "reversing layer".
- the 1919 solar eclipse showed perhaps the highest [[Solar prominence]] height of about 800k kilometres, which is more than the [[solar radius]].
- Prof. Young's description of the shattering of the big solar prominence is amazing!
