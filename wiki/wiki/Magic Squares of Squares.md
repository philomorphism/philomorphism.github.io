comments:
1. [The Parker Square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOT_bG-vWyg): matt is talking about magicsquare of squares

2. [Magic Squares of Squares (are PROBABLY impossible)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdsj84UdeYg&t=0s): Tony formalizes the problem, and proves that it's almost unlikely. 
   some papers: [springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02985794), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08908), [springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-8655-1_2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=ac959537-cb35-4b9b-b61c-6da95b1cce4a).
   some buzzwords: [[diophantine geometry]], [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], [[Vojta's conjecture]]
   types of curves:
- rational curves, e.g. the circle parameterized with a line
- elliptic curves, e.g. the standard cubic one
- general curves, surfaces?
- perhaps for all n>=4 the magic square exists, but might not be true for 3. because the dimension of space is growing faster than the number of constraints. n^2-1 dim and 2n+2 constraints.
- euler's magic sqaure sent to lagrange is a key to "natural number being a sum of four squares"
