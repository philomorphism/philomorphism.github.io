problem 1: long computation?
problem 2: [[grandfather paradox]] (this is not a paradox, everything is consistent)

[[Quantum mechanics near closed timelike lines]] proposes that if CTC exists we should think of it as a region of [[space-time]] where nature is forced to find a fixed point for whatever the evolution operators is acting there. 

multiple fixed point could exist! e.g.
grandfather anti-paradox: back in time, introduce young grandfather to young grandmother.

this forcing nature to find a fixed point breaks linearity of quantum mechanics, which gives computational power. e.g.
Shakespeare paradox: go back in time and hand him the complete works of shakespeare. this doesn't give rise to a grandfather-like paradox, it's totally consistent with "physical" timeline. but computationally it introduces enormous information/computational power!
