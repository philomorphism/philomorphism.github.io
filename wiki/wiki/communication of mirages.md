will explain later, but it's about people talking to each other (most of the time it's one of the two, why?) in a completely random way and yet in given subjective experience it feels the talking is well-defined or is fairly consistent. I call the concepts and ideas being communicated in such a manner a mirage of the landscape of a given thought process, because they only appear to be "existing" there, but are not. that is, they're not really the things being communicated but feel as such, why? what's the solution etc... related to [[who did it first]]?
