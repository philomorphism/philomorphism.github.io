there are bunch of dualities in math/sci. (some of the things mentioned here are not really "duality" duality, but they're still here.)

1. [syntax-semantics duality](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/syntax-semantics+duality)
2. [[duality between algebra and geometry]]
3. [[Duality of Compositionality and Composability]]
4. [[intension-extension duality]]
5. algebraic logical duality / linguistic duality
6. outside-inside duality [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQvazsnkriA&list=PLl8xLayCI7YcFU3huTvSPC11xBFioxtpo&index=2&t=1706s&pp=iAQB) 
7. spatial-temoral memory duality, [[what is life by Paul Nurse#^025f47]]
