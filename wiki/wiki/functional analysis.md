lax's [book](file:///media/xinyaanzyoy/xyz/XinYaanZyoy/port_1969/lib/STEM/math/theory/calculus/analysis/functional/(Pure%20and%20Applied%20Mathematics_%20A%20Wiley-Interscience%20Series%20of%20Texts,%20Monographs%20and%20Tracts)%20Peter%20D.%20Lax%20-%20Functional%20analysis-Wiley%20(2002).djvu) seems to be good one, and [[Frederic Schuller]]'s [[Lectures on Quantum Theory by frederic schuller]] seems to have a big intersection. but still, I'd like a book that focuses more on qm, like the way schuller does his lectures, AND a book that's concise, like rudin itself ig. also, compare stein and shakarchi's vol 3.
