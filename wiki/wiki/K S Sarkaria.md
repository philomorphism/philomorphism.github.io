I do not know who this person is (I'll explore their site late) but seems interesting to me. i found them in [this](https://twitter.com/MrsDoubtwater/status/1731402151040061499) tweet on [this](https://twitter.com/IsomorphicPhi/status/1731217134372495428) thread. they sent [this](https://kssarkaria.org/Quotations%20Sources/Arnold%20Forgotten%20and%20Neglected%20Theories%20of%20Poincare.pdf) referring to the 2nd page quote on the top. but as Iso mentioned it feels weird that [[Vladimir Arnold]] would write such a thing, so yeah i'll come back to this later.
