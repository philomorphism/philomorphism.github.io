## Reading Notes
### 1st Lecture: Capitalism 
- steel king serves unlike the feudal kings who ruled.
- before capitalism poor/rich retained their status their entire life.
- overpopulation in the old days caused outcasts that became real menace to the preservation of the prevailing social system of the time. this was because the local industries or the processing units were exclusively to serve the ruling class.
- while talking about current developing countries we should not forget the state of 18th century England. there were several problems, e.g. of about 5-6 million of population 1-2 million were simply poor outcasts for the existing system, meaning that they neither ruled nor served, they had no position. what to do with them as the population increases was a big problem. another one was that of lack of raw materials: what is to be done when the forests will no longer give the required wood for the industries and for heating the houses. it is obvious that that was a big problem for the ruling class.
- some among those outcasts began producing goods that not only served the ruling class, that needed expensive goods, but also for everyone's use cases and need, that is cheaper goods. this was the beginning of capitalism. this was the mass production to satisfy the masses, the fundamental principle of capitalism.
- freedom doesn't imply that of copying but that of creativity. the right to serve a customer better and cheaper.
- in spite of all the benefits, capitalism has been criticised not by the masses and the workers but by the noble class of England. the answer to almost all such criticism is a simple statistic that in the era between 1760-1830, when the industrial revolution brought capitalism, the population of England doubled. 
- why is [[Karl Marx]] wrong? about what exactly? i hope to learn in depth in comping chapters but for now it seems that marxist view is to let the government run the means of production to have constant wage of labor or something, that they don't need more than what is required to sustain life. this might be a biased view of marxist ideas, so i'll not judge for now.
- the german economic miracle is due to capitalism. 

### 2nd Lecture: Socialism 
- 19th century liberalism is different, in fact is opposite, to that of 20th century. The latter one thinks all other kinds of freedom can be attained in absence of economic freedom.
> The meaning of economic freedom is this: that the individual is in a position to choose the way in which he wants to integrate himself into the totality of society. The individual is able to choose his career, he is free to do what he wants to do.
- freedom in the framework of society not metaphysical complete freedom ofc.
- mises argues against rousseau's "man is born free and everywhere he is in chains" by saying that man is not born free because the protection by parents and their protection by the society is what made a baby a man.
