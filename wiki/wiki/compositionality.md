#: [[Duality of Compositionality and Composability]] 

this is a philosophy. seems to be working for most of the sciences. the very reason why this philosophy works is that science runs on the reductionist philosophy and that's like the inverse map of the compositionism (new word!). 

this is very much like thinking everything in terms of "processes". is process thinking of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] related?

there's a post [On Compositionality](https://julesh.com/2017/04/22/on-compositionality/) by [[Jules Hedges]], check that out. jules says that if a system is not compositional it's a barrier for us to do science on it.

a recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/_julesh_/status/1673351605444395008) by [[Jules Hedges]], on which [[Matteo Capucci]] has an interesting [thing to say](https://twitter.com/mattecapu/status/1673613465393479680). [[Fabrizio Genovese]] seems to have the answer, which jules [says](https://twitter.com/_julesh_/status/1673676078290747393?s=20) is to the question of [[cohomology theory of lax functors]].

how is [[goodwillie calculus]] related here?

what really matters while talking about compositional stuff? [[Fabrizio Genovese]] has a [thread](https://twitter.com/fabgenovese/status/1673413537585065988?s=20).
