learn it! it's a functional programming language with strict? typing. have heard about it being [[category theory]] related. learn along the way [[lambda calculus]] and [[type theory]]. perhaps start with [[Haskell Beginners 2022]].

there's a beautiful Haskell game where type signatures and functions are to be matched. I can't find it right now.

checkout [TypeClasses](https://typeclasses.com) book+documentation kinda thing.

checkout something something relation algebras something something haskell by wolfram kahl and gunther schmidt.
