## Notes
### Preface
> You only think you know, as a matter of fact. And most of your actions are based on incomplete knowledge and you really don’t know what it is all about, or what the purpose of the world is, or know a great deal of other things. It is possible to live and not know. - [[Richard Feynman]] 

> I believe in the discipline of mastering the best of what other people have figured out. - Charlie Munger
### Acquiring Wisdom
> There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says "Morning, boys. How's the water?" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes "What the hell is water? - [[David Foster Wallace]]

> I don’t want to be a great problem solver. I want to avoid problems—prevent them from happening and doing it right from the beginning - Peter Bevelin 

- Multidisciplinary thinking is the way to build lenses/models and be able to shift perspectives smoothly.
- "Our failures to update from interacting with reality spring primarily from three things: not having the right perspective or vantage point, ego-induced denial, and distance from the consequences of our decisions."
- for the first one, right vantage point (though it's not really about "right" but about more than complete), he gives the well known example of the ship of [[Galileo Galilei]] moving with a constant velocity and stuff. as i understand it, he asks us to have more than complete understanding by communicating with the x-ray vision fish outside or at least doing computation from the fish's reference frame to get more information about the ball's trajectory than just the one we'd get from that of ours on the ship, even though it is mathematically complete one.
- second one is ego-induced denial of the truth. he says we either fail to communicate in fear of criticism or when we do and get criticized we end up defending instead of communicating the ideas. and i feel like this is the most basic kind of stupidity, emerging perhaps because of the modern schooling structure.
- we keep ourselves from any kind of change so that we don't have to learn anything new. this makes us comfortable in the zone of consequence of our decisions even if they're bad. 
- he makes a good point here: learning from mistake (touching a hot pan) is not about learning in an atomic manner or as a micro lesson (to not touch a hot pan or to check before touching) applied only to a certain situation (touching a hot pan), but learning general lesson (to not touch anything hot or check before doing so.) that might apply to many situation, and not only that but an abstraction of that generalization too! that is, to be cautious before doing anything that's an action! (i am not sure if he went that far in the book though)
> A man who has committed a mistake and doesn’t correct it, is committing another mistake - [[Confucius]]
- understanding of the world through principles -> development of causal relationships -> matching patterns -> ability to draw analogies
- ego is both an enemy and a friend. (let's not get into the semantic details) need to learn when it is what. "We optimize for short-term ego protection over long-term happiness."
- “To the man with only a hammer, everything starts looking like a nail.” is why Multidisciplinary thinking is important.
> The chief enemy of good decisions is a lack of sufficient perspectives on a problem.
- this ideas of having multiple perspectives for the same truth makes me recall what once john baez tweeted. (about dissecting the cat thing, find the tweet in his archives)
> 80 or 90 important models will carry about 90 percent of the freight in making you a worldly-wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight. - [[Charlie Munger]]
- Better models make better decisions
> I think it is undeniably true that the human brain must work in models. The trick is to have your brain work better than the other person’s brain because it understands the most fundamental models: ones that will do most work per unit. If you get into the mental habit of relating what you’re reading to the basic structure of the underlying ideas being demonstrated, you gradually accumulate some wisdom. - [[Charlie Munger]] 
> Disciplines, like nations, are a necessary evil that enable human beings of bounded rationality to simplify their goals and reduce their choices to calculable limits. But parochialism is everywhere, and the world badly needs international and interdisciplinary travelers to carry new knowledge from one enclave to another. - [[Herbert Simon]] 
- build a repertoire of models and use them in a feedback-loop way by acknowledging, reflecting, and learning from the situations, write journal about it. (i might log into the diary section of this wiki)
### The Map is not the Territory
> The map appears to us more real than the land. - D.H. Lawrence
- map is ofc just a projection of only certain structures of the reality, not all. so a map of territory is not territory itself. "The abstraction is not the abstracted" i like it!
- I should read [[Science and Sanity An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics]] to get an idea of how abstraction helps in real life.
- "if the aim becomes simplification rather than understanding we start to make bad decisions"
- [[Tragedy of the commons]] (a weird thing really)
- **TBC** ... (47:57)
