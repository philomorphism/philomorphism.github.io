we often hear the phrase "the current government is good/bad". that doesn't make sense, wasn't a system supposed to "work" at all costs, especially that of inter/national [[governance]]? 

Is it even possible to construct a governance system that doesn't need a [[moral dichotomy]]?

#: [[dichotomy]]
