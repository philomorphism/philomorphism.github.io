## Things I learned from her:
1. Small talks require active questions (I do ask questions but I should ask questions to "people" that too of the kind that brings small talk into action)
2. write your own manifesto! (i wonder why it didn't occur to me when i was doing similar projects and failed lol)
3. writing a diary of thoughts. (i am not sure I can do this on paper due to my dust issue but I think I will now try to make it routine to write a diary, perhaps in the morning, but as it has failed many a time before, it has a chance to again, so i think I'll wait for getting some deep purpose to do it)

## Books I should read/skim through
the hashtags are the videos where the book was either mentioned or was seen in the background:
1. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94669.The_Mistress_of_Spices
2. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201213405-die-wildnis-des-winters (this is going to take a lot of time to read given it's in german, but I'd still love to do it. I think learning german would take way longer than it did to learn Chinese and Russian because I was young back then and German seems a bit complicated, but I'll try for sure (not duolingo lol))

## YouTube 
### 1. How I celebrate the New Year in the RAUHNÃ„CHTEN 
src: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44XX4TfVWmY) 
my pre-video stuff:

the [rauhnacht](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raunacht), the time between the years, is some sort of special set of 12 days in the german world, somehow it goes far beyond the birth of the christ even though the 12 days kind begins with the christ's birth. the 11 days and 12 nights is actually the gap between the 12 lunar cycles and one solar cycle.

people believed that the unknown dark metaphysical world was in contact with the earthly human world, and that the dark metaphysical world contained spirits of the dead. so naturally they tried to protect themselves and their stuff from those spirits with some weird rituals. 

whatever the origin of the days be, there is a ritual of smoking the house with incense and stuff that are believed to cleanse and bring positivity. there's an oracle future prediction and stuff, a dream interpretation (so people write it, I am sure Julina writes them?), a wishing thing, etc... all these happen every day of the 12 days representing the entire next year.
___
the video:

intro to the 12 days:
the rough/smoke nights are for reflection, as Julina says. reflect on the old year, feel gratitude, and prepare for the new one. she didn't know of these days as spiritual for a long time? 

preparation for the 12 days:
the preparation of the days begins at the night of the winter solstice (dec 21). this is the point of the darkest sky (because the north pole is maximally tilted away from the sun), after which the we move towards light (the increasing length of the day). preparation consists of smoking the house by burning incense or something to drive the evil spirits out. she loves the smell of the smoke of the palo santo, and purple candles. (FIND THE ORAKEL VIDEO! @4:45) oracles are good advisors! preparation also consists of writing a diary! (I noticed she write on paper even though she has an e-ink) she recommends making a playlist in the preparation days for the rough days. (she shared this playlist (the other mentioned one is not there): https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2bwZjsaFafuqFzzgwNjolt?si=a69b367997d34c5c). 

the rituals of the 12 days:
1. write down the worries on paper and burn them, lol.
2. in the preparation days, write the wishes down, they don't have to be materialistic, not even realistic! (okay I want to go to the proxima centauri and come back safe without losing tempotal life back on earth haha). exactly 13 wishes. burning each every night without looking at it. the last one has to be fulfilled by the self, the burned ones are fulfilled by the higher beings.
3. the very first thing she does in the morning is writing the night dreams down. writing them in the preparation days makes it easy to tell the brain that the dreams are important to remember them. interpret those dreams and see the common thread that helps write a more concrete goals than just a new year's resolution.
	> looking at how you react to things in a dream is much more meaningful than looking at what happens.
4. then she looks at the bright day sky and writes down about it.
5. then an intensive long walk.
6. then a small gratitude ritual: the philosopher's stone (hah!) which she takes in the hand imagines the most beautiful thing that happened that day. 
7. meditation
8. writing a letter for the corresponding month on every rough night.
9. smoking incense (I think really smoking not the house!)

to get to know yourself better, you write a manifesto! yes right! but not only that you print it! whoa! that's so cool! "Julis Manifest"

### 2. It is spring in the Bamberg Hain
src: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9346-k85zw) 
I have never seen such a dense natural life, that too mixed with European architecture. just wonderful! I def want to live in such an environment, but i hear the german rental real estate is above the mountains lol. I like how she uses nature to find purpose in life. she seems to have observed the nature I never have, even I though I've always tried to. I just wonder how someone could be this peaceful, gentle, natural, smooth, flowing, etc etc in life. she def inspires me. she inspires me to live life, because she makes me feel like I haven't lived at all! I am an alive corpse, or perhaps that's the threshold of the lowest bar for what living life is for me, and she seems to be out of the horizon of my imagination. so cool!

oh btw she seems to have offline-d her site, there used to be a bookclub or something, I should ask her why.

I was wondering if the entirety of the Germany looks as beautiful as this. I know that Julina is in Bamberg (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg) so I read the wiki page, and what I find is that it really is a unique place, medieval architecture, the nature, everything is beautiful here! oh [[Christopher Clavius]] was from this place! 

### 3. Become a bookworm: tips to read more! ðŸ’›ðŸ“–
src: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epQK07xNTNk)
1. Enjoy Reading: oh she mentions in this video that did close the book club! thinking of reopening it.
2. take the pressure off: reading goal doesn't work, and is not a right approach. "you can cancel a book"! cool! haha. 
3. where do books come from?: she mostly borrows, and buys old books, but still spends about 15 euros! that's something!
4. make reading a habit: that book and mobile comparison is effective!
5. intensify the experience: reading diary! that's obsidian for me. but she now uses notion.

### 4. Be honest with yourself - how are you?
src: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV0AxoJEo6g) 
not fine for sure lol.
- thunderstorm cleans the air, well, yeah ok. 
- the tree hugs are something.
- whoa! she filmed a snail! so cool!!!!
- edible wild plants! not sure if i'll ever get a chance to experience the wild forests.

### 8. How I celebrate the RauhnÃ¤chten on a skiing holiday
src: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUX-TEpxgZQ) 
she loves smoke nights it seems!
- she doesn't have goodreads, makes complete sense to me, I'm planning to move to obsidian even for books organization and stuff, but will see.
the questions:
1. **what mood do you wake up these days?**: I wake up at evening, so it's pretty weird and a bit exhaustive, but after a while the night calms everything down and then suddenly I'm the most conscious being I know of on this planet.
2. **What is the question you are asking yourself most often at the moment?(?) What do you think about when you start your day?**: the question i ask myself a lot is what is this place, will i ever understand it? i think when i start the day i usually think about what i am gonna learn today.
3. **Do you have a place close to your heat?**: Antarctica. the place I've never been to but the place I want to live in.
4. **Have you visited it this year? in reality or dreams?**: nope, sadly. and idk.
5. **What has given you a feeling of lightness?**: the greenbank night stargazing.
6. **With whom were you allowed to be a child?**: -

- dec 28th is the day of the innocent children!
- love that botanical letter writing set

### 10. I lived in the fairytale forest for a week
src: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDLu2HbbOYw) 
the sounds of animals in the winter forest is such a cool thing to experience.
> we as humans often ask ourselves what's bothering us right now instead of asking what would be good for us now and what we want now.

life!!!!
indeed a fairytale. just wow. I like her outro line ending with "stay curious".

### 12. Sometimes spring hurts
src: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jht27rEho9w) 
I love how inspiring the nature is but even more so how inspired she is by it.

there is space, maybe for spring!

### 13. A walk into the sunrise
src: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJUcdPGcMa8) 
the memories of my childhood, If i have them, they're mostly of me on the rooftop reading stuff in the morning sunrise. this video is such a beauty I want to live in a city where the woods and ocean and river and the mountains and anything that the nature has to offer is by the walking distance. 
- she wants space and silence for art, political commitment, and the existence/possibility of space and silence. (i'm not sure if the translation is correct.)
