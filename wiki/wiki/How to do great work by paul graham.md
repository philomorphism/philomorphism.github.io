- my conclusion: **curious exploration is the key, which has been my belief ever since i remember**
- he mentions 4 "steps" (which they really aren't! as he later mentions they intersect a lot, things happen simultaneously, it's only later or perhaps periodically that yo go through these "meta-steps"):
	- choose a field, 
	- learn enough to reach to the frontiers, 
	- notice gaps, 
	- explore promising ones. 
- education system doesn't help at all in either of the steps, except perhaps the second one.
- when in doubt, optimize for _interestingness_
- strange and different is better, but only if you've a sufficient arguments for it, beauty is fine, ig.
- a thing you're curious enough that people get tired is the thing you want to do
- you're not supposed to be loyal to "people of a field" but instead to "field of knowledge people".
- work for the self, not for more sophisticated imaginary people or less of that, because in the former case you're lost, and in the latter case you're you've to be cynical, and if you're good at being sufficiently cynical then perhaps you might make good money but that's not good work
- you might need boldness for the resistance but not really a plan.
- "Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants" (OH BOY! I feel like parallel-me wrote this essay!)
.... **CONTINUE READING THIS LATER**

- The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal, mathematical sense, and they are:
  - ability
  - interest
  - effort
  - luck
- find a point in the intersection space of ability and interest
