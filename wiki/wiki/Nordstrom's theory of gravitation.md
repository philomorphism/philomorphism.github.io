[[Edward Witten]] mentions this [here](https://youtu.be/UjDxk9ZnYJQ?si=XByRzEFRPWJoAzmm&t=539) saying that he is surprised that [[Albert Einstein]] didn't consider it, but [[David Gross]] replies he is sure that Einstein considered it but that [[Equivalence Principle]] made him look for different one.
