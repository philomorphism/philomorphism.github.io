## Review 


## Reading Notes
### Chapter 1: Tilo
How the fuck are words giving me the sensations of the actual spices? I wonder how would one who has never had physical experience with Indian spices and sweets might imagine the picture portrayed of the store here.

The story of the birth and life of Nayan Tara seems like that of typical unwanted indian girl child, except when she figures out the nature and she has all the power at her will, which brings her and her family an element of luxury. I think this is to introduce her intelligence not some metaphysical powers, but we shall see.

I still wonder though if Nayan Tara is who become Tilo, the Tilottama.

### Chapter 2: Turmeric 
The intro to Turmeric is pretty classic I would say, as in it uses the facts the old people usually believe in. But it's wonderful how she (Tilo?) finds something deep in the way Turmeric farmed, which she says picks out only at a specific time, that of when she sees something in the night sky (which she says is the star called swati, the sanskrit name of [[Arcturus]]).

Lalita, Ahuja's wife, seems to suffer through the typical old indian men's narrow mindset. Oh, and that desire of a baby, so common to lonely heartbroken married women I suppose, but who am I?

She was once called bhagyavati by the pirates, well because hmm. She's the queen of pirates now! What a being.

Scary snakes. They saved her twice!? Back at the fields against the sunlight and here at the ocean against the typhoon. The sea serpents, the snakes, she says, comes on the surface water only when the [[north star]] is visible. So it's them who introduced her to the island of spice. Snake-maiden!

She hopes Haroun takes her to the serpents of the oceans beyond the red-gold bridge. Let's see. He left his job, and now has his own cab.

Now comes how she became mistress: the only hands in which the spices sang back.

Sunday is for Turmeric.

### Chapter 3: Cinnamon
Cinnamon is something I've loved ever since I was a kid, it is perfect, not too spicy, not too hard, etc... it brings freshness like no other spice to my existence, I hope this chapter is on something of that line.

Thursday is for Chili. 

Jagjit is going through obvious thing that happens when the old and new world tries to merge.

>  I have learned how deep in the human heart vanity lies, vanity which is the other face of the fear of being unloved. - [[The Mistress Of Spices -- Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni -- Women's Prize For Fiction Longlist, 1998 -- Anchor Books -- 0385482388 -- 738ad8962af9f5b50aafa3adb0c12257 -- Anna’s Archive.pdf#page=38&selection=42,7,43,54|src]] 

Okay, she now has the new sisterhood name, Tilo. So Nayan Tara, and Bhagyavati, and Tilottama are different names of the same female throught her life, as a girlchild, as an abducted girlchild and the queen of pirates, and as the sisterhood life of a mistress of the spices. I think we're supposed to imagine it as three phases of an Indian female, from young teenager full of dreams and hopes, to perhaps unsuccessful marriage to an NRI, to economic independence, and independence in its most general form. Loved it!

### Chapter 4: Fenugreek
I don't like this Tuesday's spice. Let Chitra "chitra" it good to me haha.

bougainvillea girls, the beauty I feel, I hope will turn out to be like I imagine.

The old one gave her a knife as the returning gift. "To keep you from dreaming" Gives me certain way to interpret this section, but I'll wait before I make it final.

She getting (or almost choosing) Oakland perhaps signifies how from all the places in the world it's this that she both had to and did choose. 

The American beauty. 

I do not understand this chapter. So I dislike it just as I do the Fenugreek seeds.

### Chapter 5: Asafetida
Is it Friday spice? There's no "indian dish" without it. I love it sometimes, and not the other.

An American beauty again!

He was "just looking around" as I often do because the environment feels just right, something to soak my existence into, even when I don't know what it is.

A help is all it takes.

Okay, so after her inner shock and stuff after her amircan, she's talking about riches.

> “What crack?” 
> “Life-lust, that craving to taste all things, sweet as well as bitter, on your own tongue." - [[The Mistress Of Spices -- Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni -- Women's Prize For Fiction Longlist, 1998 -- Anchor Books -- 0385482388 -- 738ad8962af9f5b50aafa3adb0c12257 -- Anna’s Archive.pdf#page=73&selection=6,1,9,18|src]] 

I like this quote. I think Julina mentioned something along this line about yearning. One of my favourite quote is [[Susan Sontag#^1a659f]], which seems to fit so well here. 

Geeta's grandfather being a typical Indian grandfather, haha. I hate the way geeta's family handled her personal life. I think her parents are shortsighted, I thought the father was good, but doesn't seem to be based on silence, or perhaps is, idk, we shall see.

### Chapter 6: Fennel
It is something that was always there in my life but, me being shy even to experience the existence, never either tried with conscience towards its smell and taste. I do faintly remember my middle school days when I became fascinated with the existence of this beautiful thing. I can smell and taste and touch it in my mind, the green beauty.

Lalita, Ahuja's wife, and her emotionally challenging marriage story resembles that of someone I know, except it wasn't USA but india. A financially independent daughter marrying just because the society will think ill of the family, and especially the father, is such a well known and heartbreaking story. I want complete anarcho-liberal capitalism with certain base level of public infrastructure to let such situations direct into happy ending with socio-psychological progress. I'll try my best to make this happen, or I'll die trying. But I cannot, morally, afford to live in a world of such a bizarre stupidity. 

Fennel is a Wednesday spice. 

Why did haroun did what he did?

Okay, that was close, but why? Next time!

Holy, what has happened to jagjit! The usual saved from one gand by another, slavery disguised as friendship rituals.

### Chapter 7: Ginger
Tilo went out! Changed attire! Met Geeta, and it went great! I want to learn how to help, everytime I've tried either saying something good or helping someone I mess it up with my social anxiety ordered (!ya) state.

Your tilo will not let you down, we shall see.

### Chapter 8: Peppercorn
