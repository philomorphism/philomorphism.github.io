#: [[Entropy problem of cosmology]]

[[black hole]] is a source of entropy!
entropy of a [[black hole]] is proportional to its surface ares ([[Black Holes and Complexity lectures by susskind]]). and as the black hole expands (why?) the entropy therefore increases. but [[thermodynamics]] says having entropy is having temperature, so there must be radiation of some sort. and that's what [[Stephen Hawking]] proved in [[Particle creation by black holes by Stephen Hawking]].
