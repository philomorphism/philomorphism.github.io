>**Definition.** A **coseparable coalgebra** is a coalgebra for which there exists a multiplication that obeys the Frobenius and special laws.
>
>Notice the subtlety: such a multiplication has to _exist_, but we don’t pick a specific one. So coseparability is a property of a coalgebra, not an extra structure.
