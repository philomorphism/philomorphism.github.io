people suffer because they're not selfish enough. but people make others suffer because they're selfish, that is more than selfish enough.

the real question, ig, is to know what selfish enough means. I, as a kid, thought my education would teach me this. but, here I am!

Every culture seems to have different definitions of "selfish enough". even sub-cultures of a geological nation don't have concrete enough definitions, and surprisingly, even in a small family ambiguity of "selfish enough" is causing all sorts of problems.

perhaps part of the definition of the property "intelligence" of an agent is knowing the complete (or at least fee-looping) dynamic definition of the property "selfishness" of both the self and other agents.

by that definition, then, I am not intelligent, but then the majority of people are not, which makes me doubt that definition of "intelligence".  

Is it intelligent to know an action is "good" in others' definition, and actually do it to not end up making others hate the self?

if it is, then it's obviously selfish, and perhaps it's "selfish enough".

but then I see no difference between "obedience" and "selfish enough".

Was Ravana not intelligent in the way Rama was?
It seems Rama was "selfish enough" in this definition, and that Ravana was more than selfish enough.
