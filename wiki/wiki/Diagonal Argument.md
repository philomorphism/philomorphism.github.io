1st incompleteness theorem says that there exists a theorem that's not provable. taking it as an axiom doesn't solve the issue because we can ALWAYS give the argument and come up with the same conclusion for any amendments to axioms. 

there are some interesting comments [here](https://topologicalmusings.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/self-referential-paradoxes-incompleteness-and-fixed-points/).

[this](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/35107/why-doesnt-cantors-diagonal-argument-also-apply-to-natural-numbers) was in my bookmarks under "diagonal argument", figure out later why.
