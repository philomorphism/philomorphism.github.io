#: [[Algebraic Set Theory]]

### Introduction
- formalization of set theory that's based on the maps between sets instead of the membership relation on the elements of sets
- just like how [[Peano Axioms]] is nothing but a description of "the" (cf. [[the number systems foundations of algebra and analysis by solomon feferman]] to find the proof of [[unique upto isomorphism]]) [[free monoid]] on one generator, the [[Axioms of ZF Set Theory]] is a description of the(?) free ZF-algebra, which is the algebras of two operations (union and successor).
- why are ZF-algebras not so different from the differential algebras?
- a [[homomorphism]] of two algebras is something that preserves the structure of that algebra. but here andre says, it is a map which commutes with the operations, and I LOVE that way of thinking!
