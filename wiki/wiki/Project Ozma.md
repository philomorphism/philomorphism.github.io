On page 4 he says the reason 21cm line was chosen as the SETI frequency is not water hole or anything! but:
> Now just then there was a lot of excitement about the detection of the Zeeman effect in the 21 centimeter line, and so we decided we will build an instrument which will be useable to search for the Zeeman effect. We would need two channels, good frequency stability, narrow bandwidths, all very similar to the SETI requirement; and, in order that the system would be suitable for 21 centimeter Zeeman effect, we would build it and do the search at the 21 centimeter line. That is why the frequency was picked, not for any profound reason like magic frequencies or waterhole or anything else. It was a way to prevent criticism of the observatory, and in a way, kill two birds with one stone.

and I can't say if it's a sarcasm.

he talks about many devices used in building the telescope, I'd like to read about them.

what exactly is figure 1?

he mentions [microwave associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACOM_Technology_Solutions) and how they gave an amplifier for the telescope. If I do indeed become an entrepreneur I'd want to build a company that provides equipments for both other companies and the research projects, especially the latter.

at the end, while mentioning the fact that the 200hrs seti observations in mid 50s is equivalent to some microseconds of early 60s, talks about how that doesn't mean they should have waited. and I love the answer:
> It creates the underpinnings, rationality, and the support for building larger systems still
