#### My question
if [[Consciousness]] and [[Matter]]/[[light]]/[[energy]] are irreducible into each other than what exactly explains the duality? is it similar to that of [[duality of quantum energy]]? in that, there exists a general theory, or is it really about metaphysical hierarchy? if so, does it itself have a theory? at what level the unification would be deemed complete?
