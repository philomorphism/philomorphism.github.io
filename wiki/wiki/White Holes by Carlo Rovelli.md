## Review
**An actual introduction to the study of white holes with actual scientific references**

Have you ever wanted a Big-picture/Intro-101 on the most cutting edge research into some of the most bizarre objects of our physical existence that too with actual scientific references that you can follow along if you eventually get interested in the ideas? if yes, and if the subject was black/white holes and physics beyond spacetime and stuff, then lo and behold, miss curiosity, White Holes by Carlo Rovelli is your barbie bible. 

I like Carlo a lot, his lectures/talks/presentations are too good to be real. he is the captain jack sparrow of piracy of scientific ideas. He, and therefore his exposition is treacherous, as is jack, to our common sense of what space, time, and stuff are. he wins your attention not by buzzwords and controversial statements that are open ended, but by beautiful subtle arguments that just dwells into you to make you glee of the infinite jest kind that you will definitely, if not eagerly, want to read all of the references he mentions. I used analogy here of Pirates of Caribbean just to let you know that he does that too, though i think i have done it way terribly compared to his that of [[Dante's Divine Comedy]]. given the number of times he has me smiling every time he writes "Beatrice, obviously" in the footnotes. I'm sure he is in love with Beatrice more than Dante himself, haha. he's funny, abstract, romantic, curious, sharp as razor's blade in his informal formal arguments, and most importantly, to me, very open-minded about every level of questions and thought-processes, he seems to have a world-view that allows him to fit together many locally consistent but inconsistent patches to form a big beautiful globally consistent chart of all the ideas that covers up the space of almost every objections you might have had while reading him. yeah, I love him. 

The book is divided into three parts: generally speaking, in first one he talks about his journey and scientific history of the study of black holes. in the second one he talks about how simplified (without any dissipation aspects) black holes turn into white ones, and mentions which of the ideas he contributed to. and in the third one he talks about the actual model of the black/white holes with the existence of dissipation aspects. 

here and there he drops three kinds of little Pandora boxes while this grand epic of white holes continues. scientific method, metaphysics, and rare life lessons! last two chapters gets into metaphysics, and so naturally into his own worldviews but he does, as always, connect them all to the study of black/white holes. I like his almost thermodynamic definition of [[free-will]] in [[#Chapter III.5]]. he has him writing "time is a storage device", which is something i love so much, which is something if you're close to me or follow me on twitter you'd  have known already, because i think of most of the things in terms of [[memory]] and stuff.

one thing i am curious about is, how does the arguments for the existence of white holes, which still remain just a theoretical possibility, yet to be discovered as an experimental evidence in the eye of our father newton's Scholium Generale, that Carlo gives in the book change or get affected by the recently published paper [[Do Black Holes have Singularities by Roy Kerr]], because as far as i have understood Carlo's arguments heavily depend on singularities. perhaps the two singularities are two different things, i have no idea, only the time (as i will study them soon) will make me understand that or perhaps that will happen only when I, lol, get salvation (that is annihilated by the heat death of the existence itself), because as Carlo says himself: "to understand is to identify with the thing understood"!

so, if you align with this saganist looking quote: "When we seek to understand white holes, we do so not as pure reason, not as part of a world different from the objects that we are trying to understand. We are processes guided by the same stars.", and this description of our very selfish endeavor of communication, curiosity, and understanding etc: "in the end, it seems to me, the real purpose of language is not to communicate. it is to get close to things, to be in relation with them", then, Hey, go get the book and make yourself a spaghetti of yourself in your thoughts as you try to understand what the fucking heck is happening inside those hottie (it's a french joke if you get it) black holes?

## Notes
### Part One
#### Chapter I.1
[[Karl Jansky]] studied the noise that disturbed radio communications using a grid of antennas in 1928. there was a regular signal with the period of 23h56m. later now, we know that it was coming from the [[black hole]] at the center of our galaxy, the falling matter radiates this kind of radiation.
#### Chapter I.2
[[Johannes Kepler]] was, because of his book [[Somnium, seu opus posthumum De astronomia lunari]], perhaps the first [[Science Fiction]] writer!

horizon is something beyond which "bizarre things" happens, but only because the distant observer doesn't know what's beyond it! crossing it is same as any other translation anywhere else, ofc!

[[Karl Schwarzschild]] gave the first exact solution to [[Einstein field equations]], in 1915 just within a WEEK of the publication of early 1915 papers on [[General relativity]] by [[Albert Einstein]]. this solution indicates that at the horizon clocks stop and space rip aparts. but the thing is, it is a solution from the distant observer, locally nothing special really happens there! [[David Finkelstein]] in 1958 computed, and clarified in his paper [[Past-Future Asymmetry of the Gravitational Field of a Point Particle]], using the same field equations, what actually happens at the horizon.

carlo gives a beautiful analogy of black holes: you go on a world tour and somehow each of your next city consequently have slower postal services, which then makes your letters to your home appear as if you've slowed down the journey! the only difference is that you can come back from the dessert, the analogy of horizon, but not from that of a [[black hole]]. and that if we instead just linger in the vicinity of the horizon and come back home, in the former case everything is still normal, but in the latter case the home has aged more than you have, a real concrete experience not a perspective difference! gravity slows down the local clocks.

> temporality is the network of the many local clocks and possibility of exchanging signals.

Finkelstein wrote an article [[MELENCOLIA I The physics of Albrecht Duerer]] on [[Melencolia I]] which is an art about perspective ambiguity, and carlo thinks this is why perhaps finkelstein understood black hole horizon.
#### Chapter I.3
carlo loves taking phrases from [[Dante's Divine Comedy]] and making analogies for black holes.

> The difficulty lies not in learning, but in unlearning.

in [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]], [[Galileo Galilei]] talks more about why turning earth is inconceivable, not that it IS turning!

a beautiful summary of relativity of time (on which i should read later in [[Reality Is Not What It Seems The Journey to Quantum Gravity by carlo rovelli]]) by carlo in 7 events:

1. **6 BCE**: If sun, moon, and stars revolve around us, Then there must be empty space above and below the earth. the earth therefore hovers upon the void. - [[Anaximander]] 
   *notice how it is not an affirmative statement, instead it is an implicative one, of the form (hypothesis p => logically implied q) entails conclusion r, and i love it!*
2. **4 BCE**: In [[Lunar eclipse]] the disk of the shadow of the earth is only slightly bigger than that of the moon. therefore moon is a large heavenly body only little smaller than the earth. - [[Aristotle]] 
   *observation x entails conclusion y*
3. **3 BCE:** The quarter [[Moon]] looks almost at the right angle to the [[Sun]] from [[Earth]]. and the quarter moon is half lit, which means it too makes a right angle with the earth and the sun. which means the lines coming out of sun connecting the moon and the earth are almost parallel. therefore the sun is way far away from the earth and moon. also, in the sky the moon and sun looks the same size which implies that the sun is way way bigger than the moon, and therefore than the earth because of aristotle's conclusions. - [[Aristarchus]] 
   *((observation a AND (observation b => logically implied c)) => logically implied d) entails conclusion e; e AND observation f => logically implied g; g AND y entails conclusion h. that's a complex deduction tbh! aristarchus suggested that it's the earth that revolves around the sun and not the other way around, but i don't see his reasoning here.*
4. **16-17 CE:** *[[Copernicus]] (16)and [[Johannes Kepler]] (17) made it clear through observations, and [[Galileo Galilei]] (17) through his thought processes in his [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]] that earth really does revolve around the sun, and not the other way around.*
5. **17-18 CE:** [[Issac Newton]] works out the theory of gravity, stating that the familiar gravity of terrestrial objects applies to the celestial objects too, and that a force can act from a distance. ([[spooky-action-at-a-distance]])
   *i think [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] didn't like this and opposed it as being a religion or something, that it presumes the existence of non-physical thing mediating the physical objects and their forces.*
6. **19 CE:** this "non-physical" thing was then imagined by [[Michael Faraday]] in [[Electricity and Magnetism]] as being "[[physical field]]". [[James Clerk Maxwell]] builds a [[mathematical model]] of this idea and concludes that there is a lag between the cause and effect of forces, and that time it takes is that of light.
7. **20 CE:** [[Albert Einstein]] tries to find similar model for the [[gravitational field]], and the concept of [[space-time]] emerges in [[General relativity]].

mass slows down time in the vicinity, as a result things fall! i don't really see the argument here that makes sense without math (I ain't no Einstein) which carlo mentions is as follows: slowing of time is equivalent to distortions in spacetime which then guides a particle in a certain [[stationary path]] which to our eyes feels/looks like the particle is falling down!
#### Chapter I.4
carlo mentions that an astronaut will know if they have crossed the horizon of a black hole just by looking at the stars, I need to learn specifics of this, but, I think, since the stars are still visible some sort of distance, rate of change of it, and the apparent network of stars would play the role here because well the world really look different in there, as he mentions later, no matter what they do they'll find themselves in smaller and smaller spheres, contrary to what happens outside, being able to go over ever bigger spheres.

okay i confess, I learned something new here and I'm almost embarrassed that i didn't know it, or perhaps did but didn't actively, idk! that the "tube" of black hole is not infinite!!!! ofc ofc ofc! how would we even make sense if it were! it is finite, though it can, however, be enormously long, and it keeps getting longer over time. but not infinitely long, because it CANNOT do that!
#### Chapter I.5
deep down the tube near the end the distortion of spacetime is extremely strong, which asks for quantum effects but [[General relativity]] doesn't account for those. if we did use it however, we get infinities as i thought was real!

there are two kinds of singularities carlo talks about, thought not explicitly, i think: that of the spikes in spacetime and that of the ?black hole itself?

the interesting thing is not in the fact that on these spacetime spikes field equations doesn't work. but in what happens after the tube has stretched and shrunk to the point where it is fundamentally not possible to do so, due to the quanta of spacetime. this is when quantum effects are at work and violates field equations. ignoring the quantum effects make the tube result in a "single" line, and predicts nothing beyond or beside that. time ends there. this is where the [[singularity]] is! not at the center of the hole, where only the star exists and it falls with usual dynamics.
#### Chapter I.6
when the guide (GR in this case) doesn't work, we go beyond explore, imagine, and reason, just like what [[Hipparchus]] did by asking "what would i see if i went to the tip of the earth's shadow cone under the sun?": there's a beautiful euclidean argument just like the one by [[Aristarchus]] in chapter 3. I'll need to read his book in future: [[On Sizes and Distances by Hipparchus]]. [cantorsparadise](https://www.cantorsparadise.com/how-did-they-estimate-the-distance-to-the-moon-59eb6e6d0d0c) has a good article on it. roughly though the argument is based on the parallel lines making equal angles, and then measurement based on an actual coin and similarity of triangles.

Carlo mentions a beautiful meta-idea of how to get new ideas: with a good balance of what/how much we take with us for this imaginary voyage and what/how much we leave home. he also mentions [[Zhuangzi by Zhuangzi]] while talking about thought growing and developing through analogy rather than [[syllogism]]-istically. 

> Scientific thinking makes good use of logical and mathematical rigidity, but this is only one of the two legs upon which its success has been built. The other is the creative liberty taken with conceptual structure, and _this_ grows through analogy and recombination.

### Part Two
#### Chapter II.1
white hole is a black hole in reversed time. a black hole lengthens and narrows down until it reaches the "quantum grey zone", when it bounces off and shortens and widens out, which then is a white hole! a black hole only consumes, while a white hole only throws out. the question is: "is it possible for a matter (or anything really) that falls down a black hole cross the grey zone and come back out of the white hole?"

well, to cross this grey zone is to cross the same for the spacetime itself, which is a violation of fields equations because they describe only what happens in and to spacetime not beyond it, namely after the singularity. this requires quantum analysis, and so the real question is: "does quantum mechanics allows such a leap as that of from black hole to singularity to white hole?"
#### Chapter II.2
before we answer that question we need to understand what does "quantum behaviour" mean, and "granular" is the answer as describing the simplest quantum property.

[[Roger Penrose]] built [[spin network]] (because of the famous lecture by [[David Finkelstein]] which penrose mentions a lot in his Nobel lecture and other similar ones) theory on which later Carlo and [[Lee Smolin]] worked. 

granularity implies that contraction of a black hole must stop before the singularity.
#### Chapter II.3
[[quantum jump]]/leap is another quantum property. which has [[quantum tunneling effect]] as a consequence. carlo says it's this effect that allows a black hole's interior/tube to leap "to the other side", beyond the [[singularity]], even though GR field equations doesn't allow it and time have time stop.

atomic radiation quantum leap/jumps are "in" the space, but here we're talking about that "of" the space, and [[loop quantum gravity]] describes them! generally, the quantum dynamics describes the leaps of probabilities "in" space, while loop quantum dynamics describes that "of" space.

> The equations of quantum gravity describe a world more complex than a simple spatiotemporal continuum.
#### Chapter II.4
We imagine the black hole around the singularity, called the [[Planck star]], divided into three sections, A, the internal, B, the horizon, and C, the star.  zone A goes from black hole to white hole, and the zone B rebounds the star, which very much like what likely (due to loop quantum gravity) happened at the big bang. **the leap of zone B, or the horizon, from black to white is till under computation**, but a question remains: what happens outside as the leap happens? given that we expect the outside to turn into outside of white hole from black hole, and do not expect it to have anything that's quantum.
#### Chapter II.5
how to identify the hole to be either black or white from the outside? not possible, because both are same. both attract matter, like any mass, also things fall "towards" them.

because gravity is of the second order, it is invariant under time reversal.

from inside white hole is just a time reversal of a black hole, but from outside they're indistinguishable! they're both masses that attract masses, as all masses do! (try to understand why a projectile goes up and then down even in the revered film)

that's a bold claim, even a bit paradoxical looking tbh, so carlo gives the fallowing story with a caution that it's not going to be easy. and to show that they indeed are indistinguishable all we need is a proof that a black hole can seem to eject and white whole to eat something, which is what he does: 
- for the first case he says when a collapsing star, though improbable in a sense, ejects a particle just before the crossing the horizon with good enough force it will never be captured back again by the formed black hole and therefore will, to an outsider, look as if the black hole ejected a particle! because the time near the horizon is slow it'd take a long time for an outsider.
- so an outgoing particle, from the horizon, can't help us distinguish the holes, but we still have the possibility of in-going particle. so perhaps the in-going particle can help us distinguish the holes! but in black hole we never see, from outside, the particle crossing the horizon, because it takes longer and longer for the light to reach us and so we only see the particle going near and near to the horizon and never quite crossing it! but the same is true for a white hole! it only ejects particle, and if particle is indeed accelerating towards it, it takes infinite time to reach the horizon. 

so we can't really distinguish from the outside! only the inside and horizon can do that.
the horizon (and the inside) is not invariant of time reversal, but the outside is.

carlo talks about "gluing" the equations representing the outsides of white and black holes, idk what that means but makes sense! haha

beyond the singularity, time stops and then begins again in the reversed direction, but on the outside all is as it is! i need to see the actual equations now i feel, which i will as soon as i finish the exams, i'll skim through all the references in this book.

there are events that take place outside space and time! woahhhh! [[beyond spacetime stuff]], in this case happens exactly "between" the end and the beginning of time while the black hole transforms into white one. this is the quantum realm. (is it?)

> the reason it is rare for a good scientist who has obtained an important result to take the next step is that he is the first to have doubts about his own results. - [[Paul Dirac]] 

### Part Three
so far the picture of black hole was simplified one, now we need to consider all of its aspects, including the irreversible ones. 
some questions carlo asks:
1. What makes past and future different?
2. Why are they different at all?
3. Why do we remember the past and not the future?
4. Why is it possible to decide what we shall do tomorrow, but not what we did yesterday?
#### Chapter III.1
[[Stephen Hawking]] discovered hawing radiation in [[Black hole explosions by stephen hawing]]: [[photon]]s trapped inside the horizon can escape though the [[quantum tunneling effect]]! that's heat/dissipation. hawking even computed its temperature. 

this radiation also causes the horizon to shrink, because the black hole is getting lighter and lighter which implies less ability to attract so the horizon must have went nearer and nearer to the center (my own imagination, i am not sure if this construction fits well with carlo's or the actual science)

heat => irreversible => some flavor of heat
so heat is the mark of irreversibility, it distinguishes past from future, thus **answering the 1st question**.

shrinking of the horizon doesn't imply the interior is shrinking too! (doesn't fit into my picture of "evaporation") 

oh, okay the radiation is to be imagined only at the horizon, not all the matter deep into the hole actually escapes! ofc ofc ofc! it all makes sense then. near the horizon matter escapes, therefore shrinking the horizon, but the interior remains as it is, in fact it keeps on growing like a balloon because the star is still collapsing. which gives an old black hole, and therefore at the time of transition from black to white, a geometry of big interior (n+1 dimensional?) with a little door (n-1 dimensional?) into it.

this large volume with small horizons idea has two classes of people, carlo mentions: it is about the storage of information into an object with large volume but small surface(not hole boundary?). a box of 5 basketballs has more energy but that of 10 marbles has more information. an old black hole has less energy because of the evaporation but what about the information? anti-carlos think small horizoned holes have little information while the carlos think contrary. 

carlo gives an informative historical fact about one such dispute: [[Ernst Mach]] didn't believe in [[atom]]s, while [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] did! and we know who won, haha.

**anti-carlos' arguments**:
with dE=TdS in mind, black hole's entropy ([[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]]?) can be computed given that the energy(=mass) of the black hole is known and the temperature is the one computed by hawking. the result, which i need to learn how to obtain, shows that shrinking horizon will have less entropy. also, another argument is based on the direct computations based on [[loop quantum gravity]] and [[string theory]]. i think [[Black Holes and Complexity lectures by susskind]] are relevant here.
**carlos' arguments**:
the whole point is based on the existence of white holes or at least the existence of inside of the horizon. (i can see why anti-carlos' think what they think, perhaps they're skeptic about what can't be observed but i don't if this is observable or no, let's keep reading.) [[loop quantum gravity]] computes entropy of the black hole by that of the horizon. and so does the [[string theory]], it assumes nothing about what is inside (which is not stationary) and what happens after the black hole is no longer stationary, that is has evaporated. 

this is [[black hole information paradox]]: after the evaporation black hole has no information. things do fall into it even after that, so where does the information go if there's no horizon? 
standard resolution: "the interior of a black hole is connected to the outside by hypothetical invisible canals".

I need to look into these things more formally later: [[holography]], [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]], [[Von Neumann entropy]], [[thermodynamic entropy]], [[ergodic system]], [[entanglement]], [[Information]], [[event horizon]], [[apparent horizon]].
#### Chapter III.2
now considering the irreversible aspects, the [[hawking radiation]] and other stuff, we see that the black hole can't rebound to the white hole of the same size, it will be smaller.

**i still don't get why radiation shrinks the horizon**, perhaps i am lacking something fundamentally basic thing in my thought process, need to revisit.

but if we assume that, carlo says the spatiotemporal distortion around the horizon is too great, so it's the quantum regime and the probability of the leap becomes high(?). 

the white home then radiates weakly and then disappears, after a long time because even though almost(?) all of the initial energy of the star is lost through hawking radiation, entropy get trapped in and is only released when white hole is formed, which has a small horizon, so the long time for the white horizon dissipation.
#### Chapter III.3
"the precise moment of the bounce is symmetrical under time reversal, but the whole process is not."

the rebound was possible because of the fundamental quantum equations being time invariant. (right?) (Note: [[time reversal invariance]] vs [[reversible process]], the former is about the invariance of the arrangement of things with time as the parameter, while the latter is about the reconstructibility of the past states from the future ones, that is no information loss processes)

the answer to first question (of the list at the beginning of the 3rd part, namely what distinguishes past from future) was irreversible processes. and now carlo seems to be answering the 2nd question, namely why is there difference at all that is why irreversibility exists. fundamentally all the physical laws are time invariant but only some processes seem reversible while most of the processes around seem irreversible, why? because we live in only ONE of many solutions that exists to the fundamental equations of physics! and that we perceive the world as a fiber on one dimensional parameter, which in turn is because we perceive things to be arranged from particular to anything, that is past to future. **Thus answering the second question** (i need to read his book [[The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli]] to understand more, because it is really hard for me right now even though i kinda feel what he's saying)

carlo assures us that even though we KNOW the past and CHOOSE the future, we can make sense of the idea that this apparent difference is just a consequence(?) of configuration of things! let's goooooo!
#### Chapter III.4
open bulkhead of the partitioned volume has static equilibrium and the this is a reversible process, as in it looks the same in either direction of time. 

closed bulkhead with unequal water in two partitions also has static equilibrium in each partition but as a whole it is in disequilibrium maintained by the bulkhead. In this case too the process of this state is reversible in time, Or is invariant under time translation.

Opening that bulkhead in the unequally filled parts will start a flow in one side from the other because of the free energy stored in the initial state which by the final equilibrium state disipates into heat, movement of molecules, and other things. Imagining a time interval within this process excluding the two aforementioned extremes makes us conclude tha it has a direction of "time". The intermediate process is not time invriant.

Disequilibrium, isolated systems that ocassionally interact, and long period of equilibrium is a structure that is everywhere in the universe.

(I'm getting confused about [[time reversal invariance]] (is that really time translation invariance?) and reversible in the injection sense, I'm not sometimes sure which one Carlo means!)

The imagined time interval in the open bulkhead with unequally filled sides has to be irreversible in the time variant sense, that upon time translation in both directions process looks different. And because all physical laws are reversible in the injection sense, this process it reversible too in that sense. But is this even a contradiction? What is this saying? Is this just algebraic symmetry? Idk 

It is disequilibrium of the past because of which there is irreversibility in the present, and therefore memories and traces. **thus answering the third question**
#### Chapter III.5
[[free-will]] problem here. Carlo says it is the disequilibrium of the system we're part of that creates an irreversible process, namely "our decision", that tends to an equilibrium of the whole system. 

Carlo seems to have a fairly thermodynamic argument for the freedom of choice. And I like it so much. 

The "choice" branches the macro-presents because it is possible to have more than one paths (infinite?) Between two macroscopic states, because each macroscopic state itself has more than one (not always infinite, but perhaps for the complex systems like a human body) microscopic states.

> "Men feel free, because they are aware of their choices and their wishes, but they ignore the causes that lead them to will and to choose, and do not give the slightest attention to these causes."
> "Men think that of their own free will they can do something or refrain from doing it, opinions that consist only of this, that . . . they ignore the causes that make them act as they do" - [[Baruch Spinoza]] in [[ethics by spinoza]]

Through that [[old fisherman's mistake]] Carlo argues that even though we don't really have freedom of choice, it's senseless to think that just because there's a "perspective difference" (meta-consistently different btw) we should cling to on and not to other, and call one truth and other false. Sun doesn't set in the ocean, but it does so from the ground perspective. We don't really have freedom but we do have so from a macroscopic perspective. 

This is a rationalist world-view I think. A rationalist will try to fit in all meta-level "realities" into one big picture that globally is consistent (on an n+1st meta level), locally is consistent (everywhere), but two neighbourhoods need not be consistent from all meta-levels or perspectives. I like it so so much. If cardo didn't mean what I think he did, then, we'll!

Less entropy is more information, so how did the early universe had so much more information than ever after???

Cause and effect have no microscopic meanings.

Carlo mentions of perspective phenomena. His argument about direction of time is based on that.

Sensing, thinking, and all related processes require memories which is a consequence of disequilibrium. It is this necessity of disequilibrium for the existence of a process called thinking that we naturally feel the direction of time. 

The last line of the following quote would be celebrated in the Indian religious/spiritual circles if they read it, I'm sure!
"The time of our thinking is directional because our thinking is itself an irreversible phenomenon. Because we ourselves are irreversible phenomena. We are children of time."

**Thus answering the fourth question**

Carlo mentions [[Emmanuel Kant]] by saying that direction of time is an a priori condition for the consciousness. Knowledge is a natural phenomenon of natural beings whose senses and thoughts are macroscopic phenomenon depending on the direction of time.

Just wow!! 😲

"When we seek to understand white holes, we do so not as pure reason, not as part of a world different from the objects that we are trying to understand. We are processes guided by the same stars."

Just look how much meta stuff happened in this chapter!! So cool!

"Time is a memory storage."

"to understand is to identify with the thing understood"

Carlo says defining curiosity as we do colloquially is reductive, instead it is our desire to get close to things! (Idk why we're into meta stuff in this chapter haha)

"in the end, it seems to me, the real purpose of language is not to communicate. it is to get close to things, to be in relation with them"
#### Chapter III.6
Black hole evaporates after the time in the order of m^3 white that for white is m^4. I need to learn this formally.

Planck star of plank mass has horizon of Planck area.

Macroscopic white holes are unstable, turns into white again. Microscopic ones are stabilized by quantum gravity.

Plack mass is that of a speck of dust. So stable white holes are that small. Plus they don't have charge (why?). 

We do not yet have experimental evidence but Carlo suggests darm matter might be aggregate of white holes! Let's see! Also I'm curious about how recent paper by [[Roy Kerr]], [[Do Black Holes have Singularities by Roy Kerr]], could chang the picture of white holes given that Carlo has painted it on the existence of singularity, or perhaps they mean two different things formally? Idk.
