I'd like to study most of those philosophers who touch upon science, mathematics, and [[philosophy]] itself, that is metaphysics, phenomenology, and ontology in general.

I'm following [[Metaphysics of time reading group]] on discord, but I'd also like to start people independently of the category or theme of a subject. for that I've in mind, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Karl Popper]], [[Emmanuel Kant]], [[Rene Descartes]], [[Issac Newton]]
