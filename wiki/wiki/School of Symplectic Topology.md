- Origins of the [[cylindrical contact homology]] can be found in: ^794ed6
1. [[From Dynamics to Contact and Symplectic Topology and Back]] 
2. [[Taubes's proof of the Weinstein conjecture in dimension three]] 

> moon gave us both aerospace engineering and symplectic topology. well, perhaps even the dustful stress lol. https://x.com/philomorphism/status/1835206585175420935

- [[Vladimir Arnold]], [[Alan Weinstein]], and [[Paul Rabinowitz]] worked on [[contact geometry]] in the 70s. they prove the existence of periodic orbits of the hamiltonian vector field restricted to a hyper-surface, typically inside even dimensional real vector space.
- now what hyper-surfaces do we restrict the hamiltonian fields to get the periodic orbits? Arnold gives an answer: compact hyper-surface. in 1978 in [[Periodic Orbits for Convex Hamiltonian Systems]].
- Rabinowitz then extended it to star-shaped hyper-surfaces in series of papers (which?) in 77, 78, and 79.
- based on that [[Alan Weinstein]] realised star-shaped hyper-surfaces condition is a contact condition, resulting in his 1979 paper [[On the Hypotheses of Rabinowitz' Periodic Orbit Theorems]], which is where the [[Weinstein conjecture]] first appeared.
