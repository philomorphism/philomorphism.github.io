#### review
**A fun informative introduction to idea, history, and predictions of one of the strangest thing homo sapiens sapiens has ever imagined**

Sir Stephen Hawking gave two reith lectures, the first of which titled "do black holes have no hair" was, as is apparent, about black holes' structure, but also about the very idea about them and history of how and why Einstein rejected it and later to how accepting them implies such a bizzare thing as information paradox. The second of the two lectures titled "black holes ain't as black as they're painted" was about his own works related to his attempt to resolve information paradox, the Hawking radiation, and various speculative possibilities to think about.

Obviously, it's not a formal introduction, infact not even informal pop-sci level of formaloty that these days Carlo rovelli has adopted in his tiny books that seem to work, but nevertheless it's fun (he makes good jokes, including some french sexual ones, haha) to read/listen/watch these two lectures. Yes, BBC has audio and animation version [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06pttqf). 

But instead if you decide to read this book, just know that it contains some occasional notes by David shukam, which might help you haven't encountered physics language before that Stephen sometimes uses without explaining, though, personally to me, it didn't add anything more to what Stephen said.
