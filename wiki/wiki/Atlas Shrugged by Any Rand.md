## Notes
### Part 1 Non-contradiction
#### Chapter 1 The Theme
Rio Norte line is fucked up and the Taggart brother doesn't seem to care while Taggart sister is solving it without anyone's permission even though she do need to clear it through the board. Eddie Willers observes this and tries his try.
Mr. Kellogg resigns his post at the Taggart transcontinental with confidence and no emotions whatsoever, which surprises miss Taggart.

I think dagny unknowingly sees the John gault for the first time at the failed side track of her car.

She believes in rearden metal just as an engineer eyer, while her brother is trying hard to convince her against, but she wins at the cost of responsibility.

#### Chapter 2 The Chain
Rearden metal is made for the first time. rearden is existentially happy but socially sad, he gifts a bracelet made of the same metal to Lillian, his wife, who, and other family members don't seem to appreciate either the technological achievement or rearden' day. Phillip, his brother, asks for 10k bucks for some sort of charity which he gives but only because he wants Phillip to be happy not because he believes in charity, which he doesn't.

#### Chapter 3 The top and the bottom
jim, wesley mouch, orren boyle, and paul larkin meets at a bar, their overall conversation is "the only justification of private property is public service", and some other taggart transcontinental, steel industry, and iron ore stuff.

dagny, as a child, dreamed of working on railroads, she loves mathematics. her overall journey from 9 to 32 is depicted.

francisco d'anconia is introduced as a worthless rich playboy.

dagny never understood the reason behind the construction of san sebastian line, she wants rio norte line to be repaired. she fails convincing others, thinks about leaving but then decides this the time she needs to be here!

she didn't understand why the board unanimously voted her as a president of the operation department. upon becoming one, she fired few of jim's friends, tried to save the sebastian line by trying to branch out and putting the worst she could find on it. hank seems to be delivering rails here.

the founder Nathaniel Taggart is introduced and a bit of history and how it inspires dagny is wonderful. 

Eddie willers is having dinner with a worker, who seems to be the john galt but let's see.

#### Chapter 4 The immovable movers
I should find out who Richard halley is modeled on.

Francisco d'Anconio is in NY and he seems to have lost big sum in San Sebastian Line and mines, because of its nationalization. Dagny made sure TT doesn't loose much, but Jim seems to have taken the credit in the board meeting.

Betty pope, Jim's wife, is introduced. Their relationship seems to be that of average full couple, almost the majority of my surroundings to be realistic.

d'Anconio says Jim bores him! Haha

Anti-dog-eat-dog seems to be the complete opposite extreme of capitalism if I am right. Dan Conway is confused! Hank and dagny are a team it seems.

Wyatt sees dagny in person without a notice, which makes her feel weird but she's inspired by him. She agrees to provide him the Colorado rail in nine months, hank is more than happy to change the first rearden deal from one year to 9 months with extra 20USD per ton. They sahre some personal moments, most of which was conversation of numbers of material, applications, economy and stuff. They admire each other. They're the immovable movers.

#### Chapter 5 The climax of the d'anconias
It feels wonderful to read this beautiful childhood memories of Fransisco, dagny, and James. 

Fransisco is shown to be intelligent and practical boy, and so as a man too, which makes him influential in the industry. He (perhaps after joining the galt cult) uses this influential power to make other people loose their money. He mentions it as a good investment to dagny.

Fransisco seems to have joined the galt thing. He meets dagny before that, asks for help but doesn't elaborate. He meets her again after joining it and she's just bewildered by how much he has changed. Beautiful identity-philosophy-psychological romance in there.
