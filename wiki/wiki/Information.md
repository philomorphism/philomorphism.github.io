what exactly is information? why is a formalization of one model of information not itself an information? is this an infinite recursion thing? find out my tweet about this hierarchy of information.

define what a bit is. then you get number of bits for a given space of possibilities for a given kind of observation. generalization for any observation on any space of possibilities for this definition of bit then gives the standard definition of entropy $S := -\ln p$. so ultimately, how much information is there depends on how do you define a bit of information, is perfectly makes sense!
