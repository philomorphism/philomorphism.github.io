what IS this thing? (cf. [[Clifford algebra]] [tweet](https://twitter.com/JasonHise64/status/1587506316800446464?s=20))

perhaps start from [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08153).

there's this book on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52140237-geometric-multivector-analysis?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=6WBBoKlfDg&rank=1) that feels more like in-between the standard algebra and geometry, and geometric algebra cult. so let's read that to get a perspective on what's what and what's not what.
