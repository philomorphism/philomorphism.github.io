[[philosophy]] 

watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2yRxZCPkws) by [[Scott Aaronson]]

consciousness as a physical process makes sense because well there's this entropy thing that gets affected by the act of thinking! but so does it makes sense to think of consciousness as a metaphysical process because, well, it is "me" who is "aware" of the things. in this duality I feel the former one was easier to grasp and communicate than the latter one, so perhaps that suggests something by the [[Occam's Razor]], idk!

why should i believe in [[vitalism]]?

[[sean carroll]] at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCPCyri1rXU has some good arguments for physicalism. (look for the last question regarding the self observing observer)
