### Motivating advice:
1. Go as far as you can, the world needs you, badly.
2. In time, all of science will come to be a continuum of description, an explanation of networks, of principles and laws. That's why you need not just be training in one specialty, but also acquire breadth in other fields, related to and even distant from your own initial choice.

### Wilson's principles:
1. It is far easier for scientists, including medical researchers, to require needed collaboration in mathematics and statistics than it is for mathematicians and statisticians to find scientists able to make use of their equations.

2. For every scientist, whether researcher, technician, teacher, manager, or businessman working at any level of mathematical competence, there exists a discipline in science or medicine for which that level is enough to achieve excellence.

3. March away from the sound of the guns, observe from the distance, but do not join the fray. make a fray of your own.

4. In the attempt to make scientific discoveries, every problem is an opportunity, and the more difficult the problem, the greater will be the importance of its solution. 

5. For every problem in a given discipline of science, there exists a species or entity or phenomenon ideal for its solution. and conversely, for every species or other entity or phenomenon, there exists important problems for the solution of which, those particular objects of research are ideally suited.

### Ways of scientific discoveries, especially mathematicians follow either of:
1. First through early discoveries, a problem is identified and a solution is sought. 
2. Study a subject broadly, searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena. The search is not for the solution of the problem, but for problems themselves worth solving.
