why can't i just follow the schedule? idk i can't! I am watching [[RH saga#S1E2 L-functions and the Langlands program]]. I have no idea if I'll go to the moon or mars, or that I'll earn some money next year, or what will be my profession, or if I am good enough to do mathematical physics let alone publishing original ideas, and what not. it's raining, a beautiful cool night it is. let there be another lazy thinker.

I believe people have so much power. a human body is full of power be it intellectual, physical, or emotional. I am disappointed this thing being wasted all over the place. I feel this happens because of how a social dynamics works, and how perhaps the current socio-eco-political structure is. and I feel perhaps the root cause in either case or both the case is some minority wanting to rules world through stupid stuff.
