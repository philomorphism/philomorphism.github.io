Even though I've known Anki for years, I still do not know how to use it. I'll need to do that soon. [[tools for thought]].

added bunch of books about medicine and stuff. I like biology, I know some [[cell theory]] and [[bioinformatics]] and stuff. but ever since the covid19 and then later my [[tuberculosis]] made me extremely curious about [[Medicine]] and the actual practices, so i'll be doing that soon, perhaps after the entrances but no guarantee, i am just too curious and it can absorb me anytime. but yeah i'll try my best to manage my social identity properly, that is to first focus on my local priorities like entrances.

this brings me to a thought i had that one of the reasons why people don't like me or regard me as a "learning student" is that they just look at my grades, and not my actual curious mind. for this reasons i have tried to hide my grades, but time and certain stuff made them "ask and know in return". and i feel it's for good after all, now i know that my hypotheses were correct and that now if i take any bold stance on my socio-moral philosophy towards them, I won't feel bad about it.

btw, WHY ARE MED TEXTS SO BIIIIG? almost always in the order of ~500MBs!
