[[John Carlos Baez]]'s recent [post](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2023/08/03/teaching-systems-dynamics/) is interesting. it's about how to teach subjects like [[Mathematics]], [[economics]], [[ecology]], and other process/systems flavored subjects using flow diagrams in a unified way to school kids!. [[process philosophy]] is the future i guess. he shares a paper on k-12 study, pretty interesting. writing this here to bookmark these because i don't have time right now.
