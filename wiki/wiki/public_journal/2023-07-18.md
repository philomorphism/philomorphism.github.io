I am reading [[The Road to Reality by Roger Penrose]], even though I shouldn't! I can't control my curiosity, even when I need to focus on exams. I wish I had that power. but my curiosity is episodic, when I feel it I feel it every fucking second, but when I don't I just don't. same thing with feeling romantic. I feel like this explains the fact that I'm about to be 24 in 3 months and still not affiliated to anywhere nor am i independent. I am not really reading it linearly. I've read several chapters back in 2020/21 and now I'm just skimming through other ones which seem to makes sense!
