[[hierarchy]] of thoughts from [[philosophy]] and [[Mathematics]] to [[economics]] and [[sociology]] has to be sketched on two separate boards of ambiance, that of [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]. I feel, doing the former is same as literature review, while doing the latter is almost always an open problem given the current state of the art. my purpose of this wiki is then to fully depict the first picture and perhaps build versions of the second picture to guide the future human thought. 

I am liking economics, it's all differential and integral calculus interpreted in some linguistic category of processes in which the objects simple but the morphisms are complicated. I also feel there's definitely a connection with [[Algebraic Geometry]] and [[algebraic topology]]. and it's obvious that it has deeply to do with [[differential geometry]].
