oh boy, I just discovered [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yISwMDIpCLI) video in which [[Swami Sarvapriyananda]] and [[Donald Hoffman]] discusses [[Consciousness]] and [[Mind-Body Problem]]! just wow! we need resolution to this problem. I am currently reading [[The Mind-Body Problem by Jonathan Westphal]] since last few days, and relearning some stuff i learned in the coldest winters of my life in undergrad, i remember the temperature of my mattress, freezing of my body and stuff, i was really into these stuff. now, i need to learn all the stuff formally. first gather the sources and then build my own understanding in a proper concrete written form. but yeah I'll have to stop doing these things given that I have exams coming up!
