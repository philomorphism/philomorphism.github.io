I feel like I learn all of the sciences because no matter how much research goes on, it always has some finite amount of anecdotes. e.g. biochemistry is not something I know of of even remotely, but within last week I heard/read the same vitamin C story several times. that we discovered it because sailors far into the sea waters didn't have enough fruits! same thing in mathematics, though I know a hell lot of stuff here and still hell lot of it remains to be even sighted, I can feel that anecdotes or the semantic stories are finite, perhaps a big finite number but small enough that we can manage in our lifetime, not only for one but several and perhaps all of the sciences and (theoretical) techs.
