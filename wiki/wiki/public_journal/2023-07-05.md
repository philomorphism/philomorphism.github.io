why do [[law]]s have to be "equations"? 

I mean, let's say we have a system, and let's say it's classical so there're no observational limitations, and let's say we are/have a perfect [[observer]]. so in principle we have all the "[[Information]]" of the system. perhaps in some sense this information IS what the system is. we can build a hierarchy of information here, by first taking the 2nd level of information to be that of [[endomorphism]]s of the system, and then endomorhisms of those, and so on... which level in this hierarchy really what "information" is? is there another direction in which this infinite lower [[hierarchy]] can be constructed? if so then perhaps locally we can do some sort of [[approximation]]s.

the real question is, where exactly do laws live? in which level? can they be equations of the objects that live on different levels? I suppose not, by some sort of fundamental [[type theory]] thing. but I'd very much want to know if all the laws are [[equation]]s. it feels [[natural]] that not all equations of laws, or are they?
