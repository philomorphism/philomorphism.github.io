let's go crazy! This Fortnight (July 15th): academic: [[Escher and Amann Analysis]]. non-academic: [[Science Fictions How Fraud, Bias, Negligence, and Hype Undermine the Search for Truth by stuart ritchie]], [[what is life by Paul Nurse]], [[Finite and Infinite Games A Vision of Life as Play and Possibility]], and [[The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins]].

by 15th I must know the paths of the 3 volumes aforementioned analysis book, understand what exactly is wrong in the intersection of scientific publishing and scientific method (on which, specifically [[Karl Popper]], I'll be reading about in the next round), what are five perspective on the definition of life; what exactly is a gene, why is it immortal, and how does it gain an identity; and finally how does my life so far compare to thesis on a way of life based on finite and infinite games, and which one where and when i have played. so much excited. I don't have much time, I need to prepare for the entrance but it's also hard to stop exploring and exercising.
