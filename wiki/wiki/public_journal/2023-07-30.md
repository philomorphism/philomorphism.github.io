Just wrote [[what is life by Paul Nurse#Review]].

As I understand, Life is a process, and the best abstract process science I know of is Category Theory, especially its applied side hopes to unify/formalize all the "process" structures. I want to work on the hard problem of consciousness, and because it's seemingly related to [[biology]], [[computation]], [[Information]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and all those experimental natural sciences, I felt like learning about [[process philosophy]] is the key, that's why I started reading books in biology, and this one in particular, in the first place!

I'm now fully focusing on entrance stuff, and for the times when i want to change the stuff, I'm taking [[The Road to Reality by Roger Penrose]]. I hope to continue doing this for at least till the end of September. I'll be doing [[Escher and Amann Analysis]], alebra (which book?), and some pyqs and general aptitude and stuff.
