23:14 is there a [[vector space]] that's not a [[topological space]]? asking because there's this hierarchy of spaces from [[inner product space]] to topological space and i think vector space is the more general thing than topological space. is it not? are they even comparable? i mean there's some connection for sure. [[topological vector spaces]] is something grothendieck worked on if i am right.
