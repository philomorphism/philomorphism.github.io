#: [[Entropy problem of cosmology]]

I feel [[Intelligence]] is dual to [[Entropy]]. just need to ponder more on this later. [[Entropy]] is a vector in some sort of abstract physical world, and [[Intelligence]] is an [[Endomorphism]] on that space. entropy naturally points but it's intelligence that goes acts on the natural phenomena and transforms into a new natural phenomena, that is it points artificially.
