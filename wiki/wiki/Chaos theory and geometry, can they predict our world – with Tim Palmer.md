three great theories of the 20th c: [[Chaos Theory]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[relativity theory]]
![[Pasted image 20230720233230.png]]

three great theorems of the 20th c.:
1. [[Kurt Godel]]'s [[Incompleteness Theorems]], the set of mathematical truths is much larger than those provable by algorithms
2. [[Alan Turing]]'s Proof of [[Halting Problem]], Hilbert's decision problem can't be solved by any computer no matter how powerful.
3. [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], two same powers don't add up to another for the power grater than 3.

[[fractal]] arises out of the [[lorenz system]]. it's like letting the action be acting recursively. [[Cantor Set]] arises here!

[[Simant Dube]] in 1990s: uncomputable problems such as [[Hilbert's Decision Problem]] can be reformulated in terms of geometric properties of fractal attractors of [[dynamical system]]s.

[[p-adics]], which were used to prove FLT, describes [[fractal geometry]] rather than the [[euclidean geometry]].
