A-series := past, present, future.
B-series := earlier/later order on events

B-series is kinda constant, in that order doesn't "change", but the existence of time requires change, so if time is real, it is not B-series.

now, if A and B are the only two and exclusive orders on the concept of time, then if time is real it must be (or characterized by) A-series.

claim: assumption of a time-like thing exhibiting properties of A-series implies bottom.
