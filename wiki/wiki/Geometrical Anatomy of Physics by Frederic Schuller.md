## Lec 08 - Tensor Space Theory 1 - over a field
55:15 [[hamel basis]] of [[fourier expandable functions]] is [[uncountable]], [[schauder basis]] it is [[countable]]. 

1:40:00 he puts the argument against using matrix notation for 1,1 [[tensors]].
>A gentleman never chooses a basis unless he must

## Lec 09 - The pivotal concept of tangent vector spaces
41:10 he mentions that [[algebra]], given by a vector space with a [[bilinear map]] on it (which acts as a product of elements of vector space (actually the End(V))), can't be defined on R^4. learn about [[cross product]] and how these things are connected.

## Lec 10 - Construction of the tangent bundle
6:53 he mentions what it means to be [[canonical isomorphism]]. that it is that which can be constructed within the context of language used to define the objects that are isomorphic. the example here is that, [[Tangent Vector Space]] is isomorphic Co-tangent one if the manofold is finite dimensional. he says proving V iso V** was done cannonically, while V iso V* can't be done cannonically, to do so we need to add more structure. this is the first time i've encountered a situation where we can define objects using some laguage, and also talk about their isomorphism but can't prove it using the same language. I need to spend some time on this.

1:15:17 the [[klein bottle]] (a 2D manifold) can't be embedded in R^3. just like the 8-figure can't be embedded in R^2. but by whitaney theorem 8-figure can be embedded in ???????

1:24:00 how does the [[whitney embedding theorem]] relate to intrinsic/extrensic "sitting"?
