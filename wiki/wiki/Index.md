Hey there! This is my [personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki). this wiki is not meant to be "read". The best way to explore this wiki is to look for the interesting central nodes in the graph, and then follow the breadcrumbs. though I'm not really following the original [[Zettelkasten]] method, I consider an undefined subset of this wiki to be one. I use this wiki as a repository of thoughts, bookmarks, lecture notes, paper annotations, reading plans, or research programs, book series-es, seminars, summer-schools, conferences, journals, open problems, scribbles and sketches, live video notes, and other wikis! so, there're these [tags](#Tags) that might help find the right kind of stuff, but again after that the best way is to go to the graph and find appropriate nodes to read and follow the breadcrumbs from. This wiki is also my "public" personal journal and my (not good enough) "public" personal search engine!

## Tags
only the external stuff are tagged, internal stuff, that is the network of ideas, are not tagged, because, tags are to be used only to list the relevant stuff, and internal ideas are best represented, and therefore explored, in the graph. also, tags are definitely consistent, that is if I've assigned a tag to a note it's most likely to be correct, but they're not complete, that is not all the notes that could have a given tag has it! so use search function instead!
