- [[abelian semi-group]] -> [[abelian group]] construction : by quotient-ing out the Cartesian product(?) by some sort of equating the component length by a third number(?)
- exaple: $\mathbb{N}$ -> $\mathbb{Z}$
- def: similar: some kind of [[normal subgroup]] of GL?
- def: P(R) = union of sets of all nxn [[idempotent matrix]]es
- def: [[stable similarity]]: embedding  matrices into larger size ones by adding bigger 0 to smaller one.
- def: $K_0$-theory of a ring: groupization of a the [[quotient]] $J(R)=P(R)/\text{(stable similarity)}$ of idempotent matrices by stable similarity. that is, $K_0R={\overset{\wedge}J(R)}$.
- by a [[functorial construction]] a [[ring homomorphism]] on two [[ring]]s can be attached to [[group homomorphism]] of k0-theories
- $K_0(\mathbb{F})$ of any [[field]] $\mathbb{F}$ is $\mathbb{Z}$. here matrices being stably similar is same as having the same rank
- $K^0(X):=K_0C(X)$, where X is a [[compact]] [[hausdorff]] [[topological space]], and $C(X)$ the ring of all complex valued [[continuous functions]] on X.
- example: $K_0C(S^2)=\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}$.
- any [[vector bundle]](?) on compact hausdorff is given by an idempotent matrix
