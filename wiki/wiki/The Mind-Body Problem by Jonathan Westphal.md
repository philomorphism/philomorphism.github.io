#: [[Mind-Body Problem]], [[philosophy]], [[Consciousness]], [[Mind]], [[neuroscience]]

## Notes
### Preface
- "[[Consciousness]] is a part of [[Mind]]" Jan says! wow! like, makes sense in the view of [[neuroscience]] but not that of [[Advaita]], at least as far as i can reach.
- Jon likes to seperate all other terms like [[Consciousness]], [[soul]], [[self]] etc from [[Mind]]. i think it is because of the kind of metaphysics he holds, which i hope to learn as i finish the book.
- just learned about [[glial cell]]
- he defines [[materialism]] as "the thesis that everything that exists is something material", and [[physicalism]] as "the thesis that everything that exists is something physical". though i am not yet sure of what's the difference between physical and material! haha
- [[David Chalmers]] distinguishes hard and easy problems by: "we can understand experience by the physical processes that go on when we perceive, but that there are properties of the experiences that cannot be understood in this way". and call these properties [[qualia]] (which was coined by [[Clarence Irving Lewis]] the [wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia#Definitions) syas.)
- [[dualism]] claims consciousness to not be reducible to physical process. i know this but don't really understand why to assert such a thing though, especially to those ancient people who hardly had any idea of the laws of physics.
- [[the world knot]] is not consciousness
- the author seems to be leaning towards dualism-like [[neutral monism]]
- defines [[naturalism]] as "the view that nature is all there is, so that all occurrences are natural occurrences"
### 1 The Mind–Body Problem: Background and History
- Jon uses [[Keith Campbell]]'s (informal) formulation (is this not an oxymoron?) of the problem. It's simply four propositions that do not seem to fit together, that mind is non-physical, body is physical, they interact but the objects in the classes of their adjectives do not. that's a [[inconsistent tetrad]]! 
- okay, assuming the existence of a [[consistent triad]] as a subset, there exists 4 consistent models, namely 123, 124, 134, and 234. that is denial of 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st. Jon talks about the first model, and the last model. i need to figure out if these four models have a name. 
- informally the problems is how is it that SEE a cup of coffee? how am i aware of it? even though all i am is a bunch of organs and stuff. the light reflects from the cup goes into my impinges on my [[retina]]s, which kicks an electrical signal that goes past the [[optic chiasm]] down the [[optic nerve]] and finally reaches the [[visual cortex]] at the back of the brain. and viola! I SEE the cup of coffee, i am AWARE of it. how, is the question, at least as part of the [[Mind-Body Problem]].
- [[What Is It Like to Be a Bat]], "what it is like" = [[qualia]]
- he has quoted this question: "What is it like to see a cup of coffee? Or, in more general terms, what is it like to be a conscious human being?", but i don't exactly what the question is asking as an answer. do we NEED an answer in a linguistic/scientific/logical structure? why? also, if so, aren't we still open in the question of [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]? or perhaps that of philosophy in natural science? or mathematics in philosophy? philosophy in mathematics? philosophy in everyday life? idk
- what is [[qualia]]? is it the experience per se or the properties thereof? if the former then it is an (observer-dependent) property of the [[observer]], and if the latter then it is an observer-independent metaphysical entity. 
- is qualia one entity when i observe a cup? or is it multiple ones coming together to form one? does looking at the spectrum of red emerge different various qualias?
- "The relationship between mind and body exists with or without qualia" makes sense to me in the context of "i wasn't aware of what was happening around but i did feel that something happened"
- the other direction of the problem (from that of I SEEING the cup, how can i SEE it?) is that I wanted coffee, and i MOVED my arm to grab the cup. how did i do that? how did i MOVE? through [[neuroscience]]/[[physiology]] we know that electrical signals controls the [[muscle]], but the question is how did the electrical signal originate? but again we know the answer, neurons fired them. but how did my "desire"+qualia made the neurons fire the signal? is this [[telekinesis]]? 
- [[Rene Descartes]] claime that the essence of physical is space. But we only need this: physicality implies "in space" claims Jon, and i don't really see where he's going with it.
- [[Noam Chomsky]] just denies that we even know what matter, body, or physical is, so we don't even know what this mind-body problem is!
- some stuff related to "what physical is" [[Ieva Čepaitė#defining physicality]], [[The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces by Carcassi et al]], [[What are Physical Objects by Ned Markosian]], [[The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Mind#What is the physical by Barbara Gail Montero]]
- [[Meditations on First Philosophy]] claims non-spatial things can't interact with spatial ones.
- it's not just that how mind and body interact, but that how they CAN interact.
- both [[Princess Elisabeth of the Palatinate]] and [[Pierre Gassendi]] mentioned the [[Mind-Body Problem]] but [[Rene Descartes]] didn't see it as a problem somehow!?
- [[Pineal gland]]
- experience of color is different from that of the em-wave thereof
