## Metaphysics PHIL 6320: Oneness 

Instructor: Helen De Cruz

Tuesday 1:30 - 4:15 pm, Philosophy seminar room 

(rough draft of the reading schedule and assignments, just to give you an idea) 

  

[note: if your final paper is on Spinoza, this course can also be used to fulfill your Early Modern History of Philosophy requirement]

  

This is a comparative philosophy graduate seminar where we will explore several conceptions of oneness 

- metaphysical conceptions of monism
    
- the unity of knowledge and action (Wang) and of virtue and blessedness (Spinoza) 
    
- the intimate relationship between metaphysics and ethics, which in earlier philosophical systems are not separate as in contemporary philosophy, but intertwined. 
    

  

Our focus will be on the neo-Confucian Chinese philosopher Wang Yangming (1472-1529) and the Dutch Sephardic Jewish philosopher Baruch de Spinoza (1632-1677). We will place these authors in a broader intellectual context, notably the complex interplay of Buddhism and neo-Confucianism for Wang, and the interplay of Christianity, Judaism, and early Enlightenment thinking for Spinoza. 

  

In addition to acquainting ourselves with their philosophical systems, we will also explore the idea of doing public philosophy and being a philosopher in the public sphere. We will approach (very much in the spirit of Wang and Spinoza) the prudential aspects of what is involved, and how to engage the public in a way that is effective, non-confrontational, and that furthers the public good. The course will have practical exercises to help you on the way.
