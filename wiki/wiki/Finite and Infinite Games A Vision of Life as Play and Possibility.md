### one: there are at least two kinds of games
- finite games have free players. a player that's not free is not a player at all.
- one player finite game doesn't exist.
- spatial, temporal, and numerical boundaries exist.
- place, time, and membership
- infinite players too has to be free. that's the only similarity with finite  players.
- infinite game has no spatial, temporal, and numerical boundaries.
- the only purpose of an infinite game is to prevent it from coming to an end, to keep everyone in the play.
- finite game world has elaborate boundaries of contest, its players are finely classified as to their eligibilities. while an infinite game is open to all.
- finite games are externally defined, infinite, internally.
- finite games can be played within infinite one, but not vice versa. (this feels familiar to me, i feel i had this thought just few days back where i mentioned in the diary that i forgot it)
- because finite games are externally finite, internally there're limitations on what can be done to and with each other. to agree on these internal limitations is to establish rules of the play.
- each finite game has different rules. and totality of the rules IS what a game is.
- **there are no rules that require players to obey rules** ([[Russell's Paradox]]). for this reason, rules must be agreed upon freely by the players, in fact that's what "playing" is for the free finite players.
- rules of the infinite game change while playing. it's to let the play continue instead of to make it to an end, like in finite games. the former is more like a grammar of a language and the latter is like rules of a debate.
- finite player play within boundaries, infinite players play with boundaries.
- even though all the finite game players are free, they might not "feel" so. a slave "agrees" to be one by refusing to refuse, that is oppression has a "price" which is a mark of freedom.

### three: I am the genius of myself
I love this quote:
> To speak, or act, or think originally is to erase the boundary
of the self.
