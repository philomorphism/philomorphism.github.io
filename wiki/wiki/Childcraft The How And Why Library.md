### Review 
We didn't have electricity today so I couldn't work on my laptop, I went to the library to read some physical books, and I recalled that I once decided to skim through Childcraft volumes, that's exactly what I did today, I spent about 2-3 hours on this volume, I didn't find anything new which is ofc expected given my age, teenage taste, and my academic path. 

I'd say that it's the best book in the eye of the teenage me, it talked about everything I wanted to know at the age I bought a cheap telescope and native-language books to satisfy my curiosity. This is the book a kid should pick up before any other book on the topics of space, astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, aerospace engineering, planetary science, radio astronomy, extraterrestrial intelligent beings, and what not, everything is there, that too with "completeness", at least for the kid who learns these for the first time. 

I so much wish I had access to this book as an early teen because even though I learned almost all the things in this book in my early teenage, it was all scattered over different books, that too not that complete, they were either too childish or too abstract for a beginner, I think this is a perfect middle ground book every space enthusiast kid should read and the parents should gift to.
