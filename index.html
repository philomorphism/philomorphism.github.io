    Hey there! I'm Parth, an autodidact who experiences existential crisis almost ALL The Time while studying how "Information" relates to Physics, Geometry, Logic, and Computation. <br/> <br/>
    
    let's have disuccions about anything STEM, solutions to big socio-eco-political problems, and philosophy of this unknown ocean we're all part of.
    
    contact me at <code>cGhpbC5vYnNvbGV0ZTI0MUBwYXNzaW5ib3guY29tCg==<sub>64</sub></code>.

    If you don't want to chat (or just couldn't crack the code lol) all you get is a glimpse into the hell of what a mess human thought is: <a href="/wiki/index.html">wiki</a>. <br/> <br/>

    <hr/>

    Btw, please, educate yourself, your kids, your family, your neighbors, your nation, your planet, 
    and if you're an alien, your entire galaxy. a good education is the only solution, as I'm convinced by now, 
    that both, we have, and we can afford in the first place, to almost all the problems. so, if you've lost all the hopes, 
    remember I need you, I need you to solve this BIG fucking problem, solve it, reach out to me, 
    I'll try my best to collaborate. If I die without the best (or at least a self-evolving and converging to the ideal) 
    solution to this problem (which we all know what it is without playing stupid precise verbal games), 
    shame on me and all the billions of people, and you for lossing all the hopes and not doing fucking anything 
    and just playing the safest possible dopamine game that has ever existed, that of fucking normal life, get the fuck up, 
    and fucking revolutionize how the mankind experience this existence. 
    get the fuck out there and see yourself through the eyes of agency, shoes of empathy, and hands of action, 
    how the world you as a kid imagined is not the world you're living in, and in fact none is. 
    let's build the world a kid dreams not the one fucking cheap finite dopamine game players need.
    learn about SDGs (dammit, google it man!), if you don't like the 4th one, choose any of the 17, and for once play
    the infinite game you were born to play. if even just 100 people play this game, we can solve all the big problems by next decade.
    all that remains next, then, is to explore and expand the human possibilities out into space and far into time.
    It is very important that everyone gets the same and best kind of education, that the martian kid and earthian kid gets to
    exercise the same and best possible freedom, that no kid sleeps hungry when a robot is refueling the interplanetary spacebus
    in the lunar orbit, that no kid experiences life the way a rich mother wouldn't want her child to experience, that the progress
    is universal and homgenized throughout space and time, and so on. so fucking stop doing your stupid job that make you play 
    nothing but a useless finite game, and start playing this beautiful infinite game. And please don't even think someone else will
    solve the big problems, or that there doesn't exist any big problems. stop freaking competing and start collaborating.
    just don't die a death of a finite player, because I'll know if you did.
    <br/><br/>
    okay, bye, see you soon!
