Physical Mathematics a bird view

Since I've mentioned "Physical Mathematics", let me mention few things: Prof. Balakrishnan ^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._Balakrishnan_(physicist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._Balakrishnan_(physicist))] has a wonderful book [@balakrishnan_mathematical_2019] which is not abstract mathematically, but pretty much in the intersection of abstract mathematics and mathematical physics (of the physical matematics kind ^[haha! I apologize for these various distinctions, but I think this intersection of Physics and Mathematics is wonderful enough to have multiple ways of dealing with it, and, unfortunately, we do not have a standard coherent subject definitions! even arxiv and mathscinet gets fuzzier the deeper we try to go into the heirarchy of classification. this reminds me of a tweet by sir baez [here](https://twitter.com/johncarlosbaez/status/1573267178891407361)]). there're other bunch of stuffs that I should mentions but let's keep it simple and let them come into mentions as we move forward into this weblog thing. but still, I'd like to mention few things: Arnol'd's essay^[[On teaching mathematics](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.TP/~munsteg/arnold.html)], Baez et al's Rosetta paper [@baez_physics_2010], Atiyah et al's essay [@atiyah_shifted_2010,], Atiyah's talk^[[From Quantum Physics to Number Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCCxOE44M_M)], Moore's talk^[which has a wonderful accompanying lecture on [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbZJruhg7bw)] notes [@moore_physical_2014], and last but not least is this good looking title article "physmatics" [@zaslow_physmatics_2005]. there are many such articles, I mentioned those which I have, at least, skimmed through. there're so many books on this topic, and I've mentioned none (except the one by balakrishna, which i did because I've spent more than enough time on it) because really, I haven't gone through much of the literature, this is just a beginning to me, microgenesis of which, i think, can be found back in 11th grade when a physics teacher mentioned "string theory, the most modern theory of our world".
